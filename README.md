# Readme

-----

My site is a lightly modified version of [Poole](http://demo.getpoole.com), which runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

If you (for whatever reason) want to run my blog locally, you'll have to install Jekyll, then run this while in the root directory of the repo:

```bash
$ jekyll serve
```

Open <http://localhost:4000> in your browser, and bam! Instant local bitbanter.
