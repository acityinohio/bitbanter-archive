*A picture of me looking four standard deviations more attractive than usual.*

Howdy! I'm Josh Cincinnati, a self-proclaimed (potentially delusional) funny man with interests diverse enough to constitute the cast of a Captain Planet reboot. I love design, writing, video editing, tech, bitcoin, green tea, Go (the computer language), Go (the game), Linux, Open Source (as a philosophy), standup comedy, sketch comedy, satire, elegant math, astrophysics, Douglas Adams, 90s cartoon references, and genuine academic curiosity. I am, however, a forever-novice in all that I pursue, and thus consider myself a *Renersatz Man.* I also think my portmanteaus are cleverer than they are.

I'm currently on a hiatus from full-time employment thanks to a rather annoying medical issue, but previously I co-founded an Android-focused app startup and worked at the Washington Post, doing product management and business development. I hold an MBA from Stanford University and BAs in Political &amp; Social Thought and Mathematics from the University of Virginia.

## What's Bitbanter?

Bitbanter started as a decentralized fake news project powered by bitcoin, but I soon realized:

1. I was the only one writing, which doesn't really scream "decentralization."
2. On the off chance I wasn't the writer, it was a spammer.
3. The old site was needlessly complex, but hey, at least I know [Go](http://golang.org) now.
4. You know what's actually a fantastic decentralized fake news project? The web.

So instead, with the help of [Poole](https://github.com/poole), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), my work is now hosted on a minimalist, reader-friendly website. But don't worry, I still accept (and love!) bitcoin tips if you think the chuckles deserve it. Hit me up here: *[1DzXwr9rQYTt55SXoxVyvM6pmrv5gzkGdN](bitcoin:1DzXwr9rQYTt55SXoxVyvM6pmrv5gzkGdN?label=Bitbanter&message=Tip%20For%20Bitbanter)*.

## So what, exactly, is here?

Ah, right. As I mentioned earlier, Bitbanter used to be a place for my writing, and it still is too. ([RIP Mitch](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mitch_Hedberg)) Generally I tend to write Onion-esque fake news articles, with a tendency to focus on tech/startups. But I'll break the mold occasionally, with YouTube videos, different writing styles, image-focused posts...really whatever strikes my fancy. Regardless of what I post, I hope it will engender some laughter. That's always been my mission, and always will be.

### Somehow, I miraculously made it to the bottom of the page here, and I want more of your work.

Wow, really? Okay, it's your cyber-rodeo. For my micro-musings, check out my tweets [@ACityInOhio](https://twitter.com/acityinohio/). If you really want a deep dive, try [Flailing Fast](http://flailfast.com), my first not-quite novel-length novel. I'm planning on writing a second book soon, so keep your eyes glued to the tiny screen in front of you for updates. Otherwise, you can also peruse my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUvzKxe7XmTgcj5TyyZK_Ow), which is updated less frequently (but I hope that will change soon).
