title: "\"No Need To Worry About iOS Security,\" claims Apple on Your Favorite SSL\'d Website"

*Now your iOS device will be remotely disabled (as if by magic!) while Apple installs some minor updates*

Hello fellow Apple fans! Tim Cook here. First, just want to say thanks for your continued support. I know---for a fact!---I interrupted you from completing a fully encrypted purchase of Apple accessories on Amazon, and damn does it feel good that you're an active part of the Apple ecosystem.

By the way, any chance I could persuade you to buy an official iPad smart cover instead of the third party one you have in your Amazon cart? Our official cover was designed to compliment the iPad Air just the way Apple's master of design, the venerable Jony Ive, intended. No? Well, that's okay, but after this announcement I'll redirect you to the smart cover marketing page just in case.

Anyway, you must be wondering what we're doing here instead of your Amazon checkout. That's a great question, Apple aficionado. Since you're one of our valued customers, I'm not at all surprised that you came up with such an insightful query. Has anyone complimented your creativity recently? Perhaps through a video advertisement that exhibits your countercultural insight while you're visibly using Apple products like the non-conformist that you are? I hope someone has. If not, I should definitely talk to the guys down in marketing.

But yes, back to the matter at hand. I know you just left Amazon and attempted to check your Google web calendar---but my message still comes up! Ha ha! Sorry about that, but the boys in PR tell me I need to get this one out. Don't worry! You can reply to that marriage counseling event invite later.

Truth is, I'm here to reassure you that Apple cares deeply about iOS security. For example, we've been diligently rejecting apps connected with shady things like pornography and bitcoin. Did you see that whole Mt. Gox thing? Scary stuff right? We would never want such a frightening alternative payment mechanism lay seeds of insecurity in our beautiful walled garden of apps. So that's one way we're looking out for you.

I'm mentioning this because you might hear some things in the media about a "really severe SSL bug" on iOS devices. While you're on iDevices, we're going to do our best to redirect you from those slanderous headlines that have no basis in reality, but in case our website filter fails, know that it's complete poppycock. They might throw around some scary sounding terms like "security audit" and "open source" and claim that we need to open up, but that's all propaganda.

Trust me when I say: you don't become a corporate behemoth and zenith of the cultural zeitgeist by simply "opening up" and "sharing secrets." You know what that sounds like to me? Communism. And the only red I see is our fantastic line of RED-branded accessories, which support charity, by the way. Score one for capitalism!

So that's all, loyal Apple customer. Thanks again for your amazing support, and get ready for a magical 2014! We're planning on unveiling some incredible updates to our existing products, and we'll be "Cookteasing" some truly revolutionary products to keep those Wall Street analysts on the edge of their seats. But just between us, we're not going to do anything until 2015. ;)

Yours,

Tim

P.S. Just FYI, after you're done reading, we'll be remote wiping your device to install some unrelated updates. Hope you saved that copy of Flappy Bird elsewhere!
