*Microtips to the rescue!*

![Microdimes]({{ site.url }}/assets/2014-11-18-coinbase-tips.png)

Those of you who occasionally read my missives know how much of a bitcoin fan I am, even when [I make fun of it]({% post_url 2013-07-14-africa-bitcoin %}). I've even convinced an entire room of people to listen to me [drone on about how great it is](http://youtu.be/MLTHrCPQQbQ). But truthfully, while I love what bitcoin can do today, I'm much more excited about its potential for the future---when barriers to entry become lower, when more people have it, and most importantly, when those unknown, as-yet-undiscovered ideas are built on top of bitcoin's blockchain.

One of my favorite bitcoin companies, [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), just took a huge step in that direction with their [tip button,](http://blog.coinbase.com/post/102957332182/introducing-the-coinbase-tip-button) just released today---hence the title-worthy squeeing on my part. I've been waiting for frictionless Internet tipping for a while, and this might be the most ideal implementation I've seen, from both a consumer and content producer perspective.

From the consumer side: you can set a default tip and have a single-action, set-and-forget tipping mechanism across every site that uses Coinbase's tipping button. From the content producer side: it took me less time to switch my site over to Coinbase's tip button than it did to write this post. And given the fact that Coinbase likely has the largest number of web-based bitcoin wallets, this isn't that hard of a sell for either group.

And wonderfully for content producers, there are always alternatives out there if you think Coinbase is getting too big for their britches---[Xapo](https://xapo.com/), [Changetip](https://www.changetip.com/), among others. What if you don't like running your tips through an external service? Thanks to the openness of bitcoin, you will *always* be able to "roll your own" tipping solution. You can generate a unique bitcoin address for every page and let users decide what wallet they want to use for tipping. Granted, your own solution won't allow for microtransactions, but even that may be possible [through sidechains soon.](http://www.blockstream.com/)

This is a very exciting time for anyone playing in the delightful intersection of cryptocurrency and content production. My hope (and Coinbase's, I'm sure) is that this will encourage more content makers to consider removing advertisements altogether. My more outlandish---and significantly more selfish---hope is that I may someday economically sustain my satire hobby without compromising my stances against spammy ads and draconian copyrights.

To abuse an oft-misappropriated [Stewart Brand quote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free) even further: Information wants to be free, but it wouldn't mind an occasional tip to keep it that way.

*February 10th, 2015 Update*

In a post today, [Coinbase announced their decision](http://blog.coinbase.com/post/110651254587/shutting-down-the-coinbase-tip-button) to shut down the Tip Button...but before calling it a defeat, read their rationale. [ChangeTip](https://www.changetip.com/) has better usage, and instead of poisoning a nascent API ecosystem by competing with developers, they took the high road and decided to help them out. I've transitioned over to ChangeTip and I'm still excited about the prospect of microtips in media...so play on, bitcoin, play on!
