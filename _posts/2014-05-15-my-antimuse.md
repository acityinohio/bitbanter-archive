title: "[Semi-Serious] Bitbanter's Newfound Egocentrism, My Absence, and My Antimuse" 
---

*A diversion from my normal diversions*

As Bitbanter's seasoned readers (which at last count included me, my friend Paul, and my mother whenever I send her a link) might have noticed, I've changed the window dressing around here, and -- outside the rather drastic aesthetic change -- I haven't written much in the last two months.

To answer why I devolved Bitbanter from a decentralized satire experiment into my personal Josh-centric portal, [check the about page](/about/). The "TL;DR" version, as the kids say, is that I was the only one writing on Bitbanter anyway. As an aside, there's nothing quite like saying "because I can" to explain egocentrism. (If you are not American, you should try it sometime, it feels selfishly healthy. If you are American, stop using "because I can" "because you can"...because I say so, I suppose. Hmph...I need to improve my tautological game.)

But back to the point. The central reason for this post is to take a moment to expound on my absence, on pain, and indeed, on the very nature of what inspires me to write (whoa, [heavy](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5u2unVrur1r5iwh4.gif)). I've been mulling on this for some time, and turning thoughts into words is a hallowed, time-tested catharsis strategy. And I hope at least some of it is funny, as humor writing is kinda my shtick.

## Everybody Wants a Shtick

To those less (more?) well-read, "shtick" is Yiddish/early-20th-century-New-Yorker for a "comic theme." And while that meaning is certainly apt when considering my own talents (right guys? I'm funny right?), I'm not-so-sneakily attempting to project a more encompassing interpretation. The way I view it, a shtick is a playful reflection on one's broader identity. I like to write and perform funny things. It's my shtick, and I identify as a humorist -- partially because I gain intrinsic value from making people laugh, and partially because creating an identity for myself helps confer meaning to my actions. 

Meaning is what we're all after, really. And while we can spend an eternity debating whether life has intrinsic meaning, for the purpose of this article let's just accept that I view crafting humor as central to my own personal quest for meaning. I'm looking forward to hordes of angry tweets from both the religious and the anarchical to dispute this claim, although I'm not looking forward to finding out they're all alt-accounts of Paul's to fake a broader readership. Still, he's really a good friend.

## Let's Shtick To the Point Here

Three paragraphs ago I promised I would stick to the point, and yet here we are, on this shticky tangent. I can't help it, I'm a mathematician (see? Points? Tangents? Math? I'm hilarious). Yes, I know that joke was trivially derivative and at this rate I'd be lucky if you were still reading. Fun fact: that last sentence was another math joke.

But really, what is my angle here? (Angles? Ha hah!...ahh, okay I'll stop) How does any of this relate to creativity, writing (or long periods not writing), inspiration and all that jazz? And why does jazz suddenly make an appearance? Am I going to start waxing poetic about Oscar Peterson and the finer points of jazz piano? No, but you absolutely should tip a toe into Peterson's pool. Oscar's blues could make a red turn yellow.

Right, so, my shtick. My shtick is really my identity, and from it I derive (last one I swear!) a deep sense of purpose. There's a mutually beneficial feedback loop to crafting humor; the more I make, the more laughs I (hopefully) generate, and the more it drives me to write and joke. Even (and especially) failed attempts at humor teach me a great deal about constructing better jokes and narratives, which consequently helps creates more meaning in my life.

And as it turns out, this beautiful loop turns into an absolute shit-singularity when you add the gravity of chronic pain. 

## No One Likes a Shtick in the Mud

I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I don't like to whine about my medical issues. No one likes a whiner, and I try to keep my bitching and moaning under wraps. But for the purposes of this (now practically exegetic) post, I think it's important to confront the full effects of chronic pain. Not simply the first degree of discomfort and pain, but the continued assault on the human psyche that constant, unstoppable pain generates.

It starts as mere annoyance. You become more easily distracted and irritable. As the months slowly, inexorably melt into years, your outlook on everything sours. A bleak cynicism grips your soul. You resign yourself to a life corrupted. The life that you should treasure, the productive and the social and the meaningful, become mere footnotes to one unyielding constant: the pain that refuses to dissipate.

This condition effectively became my Antimuse for longer than I'd like to admit. It was creative death, destroyer of shticks. I'd occasionally have flashes of inspiration, only to have them snuffed out by the constant application of pain. Some artists and creators can draw on pain and suffering to create some unspeakably beautiful things, and I'm insanely jealous of their spirit. I wish I could too, but after so many years it seemed that the constant pain eroded my will, or perhaps, more frighteningly, my pain-fueled depression convinced me that I never had any will.

I've been dealing with this for six years, and until very recently it was encroaching "personal lost decade" territory. Thankfully, over the last few years, I still managed to do a great deal (in my career and #jokes) that made me proud. But I cannot help but feel that all these years I've left so much on the table. The demons of unmet potential, of missed chances, of existential career quandaries, plagued me as diligently as the pain.

## Shticking It To the Pain

But I wasn't going to end this post on a dour note. There's [good news everyone](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090731021518/en.futurama/images/thumb/a/ad/GoodNewsEveryone.jpg/500px-GoodNewsEveryone.jpg). I'm happy to report that I'm in the process of real physical recovery, and I'm optimistic that my latest procedure will finally "do the trick" and transform my once-hopeless shitularity into something more manageable. That said, I'm guessing the recovery only truly begins long after the pain becomes a faint memory. Nearly a decade of cynical, existential malaise makes an emotional stain that'll require a lot more than a vigorous psychological OxyCleaning.

And part of that process will be redefining and once-again capturing meaning in my life. Which means reaffirming my identity. Despite everything, I still have my shtick. And I'm going to continue exercising it; by writing here, by making more videos, by doing more stand up, by continuing my original quest to become the affable funny-guy *renersatz man* I've always wanted to become.

So, long story short: I regret that my good humor turned sour for a time. And that I have such a weakness for corny math puns. But I'm doing my damnedest to keep my Antimuse in check, and to find purpose in laughter again. If you're still reading, I sincerely hope we'll have the fortune of finding it together. 

And I promise my next post will be significantly less *[womp womp womp womp](http://wompwompwomp.com/)*.
