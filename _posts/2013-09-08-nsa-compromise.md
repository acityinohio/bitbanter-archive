title: For Efficiency's  Sake, Here's a List of Data Sources the NSA Hasn't Compromised
---

*NSA mathematicians claim the other list has cardinality of Aleph-One*

* Apple's product release calendar
* Your fridge's Post-It Notes
* The Spokane County Chili's daily special schedule
* Next week's lineup for Corpus Christi's double-A baseball team, the Hooks
* Coca-Cola's secret recipe
* Larry Page's "Little Black Book of Affairs"
* Breaking Bad's final episodes
* Every single internal server of strategic value in North Korea, Iran, Syria, Russia, and China

Please note: non-electronic media not included on this list are, in fact, still compromised. Newly leaked documents show that NSA engineers were instrumental in the development of the latest versions of both Uniball and Bic Crystal pens. The companies that develop and manufacture said pens (Mitsubishi Pencil Company, Société Bic, respectively) were reportedly pressured by their governments (Japan, France, respectively) to allow NSA input or face strict export restrictions; the working hypothesis being that Japan and France brokered an information-sharing deal with the US to allow trilateral, illegal spying on all three government's citizens.

Internal documents show this was not a smooth process, until one French engineer was "disappeared" after asking his superior: "Why the fuck do we need a $300 piezoelectric-powered smartphone SoC in every goddamn Bic pen?" His departure, alongside a backchannel, US-funded subsidy for this additional technology, led to rapid market deployment.

Still other released documents show similar collaboration with other offline-media focused companies, including 3M, Crayola, Nordic Paper, Dunder-Mifflin, HP, and BlackBerry. Outside of using alternative forms of paper/ink and never speaking or thinking, all humans should consider their writings, creative output, thoughts, and dreams at risk.

In the meantime, this author would like to thank the brave NSA operative who furnished these critical documents, despite scrawling them on stone tablets with monkey feces.
