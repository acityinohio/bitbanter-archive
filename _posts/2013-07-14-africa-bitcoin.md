title: "\"Africa is Ready for Bitcoin!\" Claims Man Who Has Never Left Northern California"
---

*Neckbearded man without passport has idealistic enthusiasm unmarred by third world realities*

San Bruno, CA---48-year-old local man Stan Steveosky made a bold proclamation on the /r/bitcoin subreddit today. "Africa's underserved is the next frontier for Bitcoin!" commented Stan as AgoraStanNotAPhobia, completely unaware that much of Africa is devoid of the basic physical/educational infrastructure necessary to make that statement true. Stan's comments quickly garnered several dozen upvotes; a remarkable feat for a man whose only mental image of poverty mirrors a vague abstraction bestowed by liberal parents. Validated by other Internet denizens who have never traveled farther than 50 miles from their birthplaces, Steveosky's views have expanded to other web outlets that have zero interaction with Africa's poor, a group without consistent access to clean water (let alone a non-SMS-based Internet). 

Mr. Steveosky, a contract developer who specializes in FORTRAN, C, and LISP, has a long history of making bold, indefensible a priori statements pseudonymously. In his various online identities, Steveosky has claimed that Webvan was the future of Internet commerce, that Google Wave would take real-time communications to the next level, and that this was finally the Year of the Linux Desktop. According to the subset of his online associates that have passed the Turing Test, Stan's confidence has peaked with his latest prediction. "His growing sense of clairvoyance is remarkable for someone who was broadly right about the Internet revolution but specifically wrong about everything that followed it," explained bitcointalk user DecentralizeMyAuthority, who we confirmed has passed his last three reCAPTCHA tests.

Indeed, Mr. Steveosky seemed buoyed by a strange sense of intellectual superiority derived from willful ignorance and theoretical hyper-rationalization. "Africa is the perfect place for widespread Bitcoin adoption thanks to corrupt state-run economies and barter environments," generalized Stan, neglecting the regional differences of a continent that holds both the successfully democratic Botswana and the warlord-run anarchy of Somalia (a barter-run economy whose dominant currency--livestock--still can't be traded for dependable electricity).

Needless to say, the broader Bitcoin community has embraced Stan's view without hesitation or serious examination. "Africa will become an exemplar of Bitcoin-based Agorism!" concluded Mr. Steveosky, who paradoxically fears crowds, open markets, natural light, and voluntary exchanges with other people. "Next stop, North Korea!"
