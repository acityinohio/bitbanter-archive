*Balmer: "Our Company Must Look Like Our Software: Haphazardly Designed and Infinitely Frustrating"*

Redmond, WA -- Microsoft announced sweeping changes to its organizational structure today, hoping to transform its well-oiled, logically-siloed money-making enterprise into a smorgasbord of interdependent roles void of accountability and reason.

In the memo announcing the changes, CEO Steve Ballmer detailed his vision in a section titled "Time for the Drapes to Match the Windows." Ballmer pointed out Microsoft's consistent record of making illogical, painfully designed software that enterprise-locked customers dream of ragequitting. He claims that Microsoft could leverage knowledge from its software and create "irrational consistency" in its product/organizational line (also marking the first time anyone has claimed learning anything from Microsoft products, excepting hand-eye coordination from the Xbox).

In a flurry of buzzwords, Ballmer bullet-pointed the forthcoming changes:

* All Microsoft employees' physical ID cards will be replaced by Skype login ids.
* Physical organization of units will dynamically and randomly change, a concept Ballmer is calling "LiveTiled-Buildings."
* Employees no longer have bosses. Instead they have a "Start" manager, who will be impossible to find without a lengthy tutorial despite being easily accessible in the last version of Microsoft.
* For some reason Ballmer repeated the word "Developers" and "Synergy" 14 times in his last bullet point.

The changes come after pressure from shareholders, who have long grown tired of seeing consistent profit and margin growth. The response has been generally positive; most shareholders seem pleased with a small chance of growth coupled with a significantly greater risk of unrecoverable implosion.
