title: Mt.Gox Reopens Bitcoin Withdrawals Via Snapchatting QR Codes of Private Keys
---

*"Fundamental problems with the bitcoin protocol make this the only workable solution," claims Mt.Gox*

Tokyo, Japan -- After halting bitcoin withdrawals due to "fundamental issues with the bitcoin protocol" that have yet to effect any other exchange, Mt.Gox announced a sudden change of heart and will allow limited bitcoin withdrawals. Unfortunately, due to lingering issues with the bitcoin protocol (and "definitely not gross incompetence or malfeasance," clarified Mt.Gox in a recent press release) the only method for withdrawals are Snapchats of private keys.

Mt.Gox has provided the general public with the full process for withdrawals: First, users must submit their date of birth, full name, blood type, social security number (if a US citizen), a recent passport photo, and their Snapchat user name. Users then take a photo of themselves with their Mt.Gox account open on a computer screen to demonstrate account ownership.

Unfortunately, due to "fundamental problems with TCP/IP, the protocol that enables the transmission of data on the Internet" Mt.Gox cannot accept this information electronically. It must be printed and then notarized by either an official representative of the Icelandic postal service or the Estonian equivalent. After so notarized, three copies of the packet MUST be airmailed via DHL. No other delivery service has access to their address in Tokyo.

Assuming everything is in order, in 6 to 8 business weeks, Mt.Gox will Snapchat your bitcoins by encoding a private key into a QR code. They will be constantly shifting usernames (for "security reasons") and each image will have a one second timer. Due to "currency imbalances stemming from transaction malleability," there is a small chance that your bitcoins may "transform" into dogecoins, and again, according to Mt.Gox, it's all the protocol's fault.

After this most recent dispatch by Mt Gox, Gavin Andresen reportedly facepalmed hard enough to feel the back of his cerebellum.
