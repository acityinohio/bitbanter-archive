*"Time to break news!" says Yahoo's current SVP of News, former Editorial Intern*

Yahoo News HQ, New York, NY -- The Yahoo News team was dismayed to discover two social media platforms that render them obsolete, one of which will be acquired by Yahoo. Current Editor of Local/Cats and Pulitzer Prize-winning former journalist Chris Chapman was the first to unearth this shocking revelation. "Just another typical day in the office, scraping Buzzfeed for cats and repackaging local blogs...until I got a call from my son," said the 62 year-old seasoned correspondent, who counts amongst his achievements award-winning coverage of the fall of the Berlin Wall and a Webby Lifetime Achievement Award for Cat Aggregation. 

Chapman was perplexed. "My son asked me if I had seen the rumors on Twitter about Tumblr. I asked if he was back on the pipe, but after a fairly time-intensive Bing search on Internet Explorer 6 I realized those were real words. And those words were actually platforms that make our content regurgitation efforts redundant. And Yahoo was buying one of them." 

He spread his findings throughout the Newsroom, which wasn't an actual room but a consultant-built Windows XP application designed to communicate in "near" real-time more "efficiently" than office email. 30 minutes later, after all the replies were assembled, Chapman realized his state of shock was not unique. Chapman added, "Great. Because debasing--oh I'm sorry, â€˜retraining'--myself to aggregate blogs and cat pictures at the twilight of my career wasn't severe enough karmic retribution for a few pieces of uncaught plagiarism in the 80s. It was the 80s for fucks' sake. Fuck."

23 year-old Yahoo News' SVP Jim Jameson welcomed the announcement and expected that Tumblr (which he "had never heard of and certainly doesn't masturbate to") will prove an invaluable asset. Mr. Jameson is excited about downsizing Yahoo News' significant original content budget, which reached "the low six digits" last year alone. "But even more important than scaling our original content engine...you have to go to where the market's going, not where it is now," said the former Editorial Intern, whose body of work included a single viral video hit and the newfound industry-wide legitimacy of cherubic youth. "Yesterday, news meant hard hitting journalism. Today, it means animated gifs of nutshots and top ten lists. Tomorrow, I bet it'll look a lot like Tumblr. Which means more gifs, but probably of a sexual nature. Not that I knew anything about that until today."

Mr. Jameson abruptly excused himself, claiming that he needed to prepare an employer-mandated "What Is This Twitter Thing, Anyway?" seminar. He did leave a parting quote, which eerily echoed throughout the nearly empty office building: "I'll be in my bunk. And soon, when you're on Yahoo News, you probably will be too."
