title: Russia Intervenes in Syria; Finally Prevents Chemical Weapons...from Appearing on Instagram
---

*Vladimir Putin: "Two words, Bashar. Snap. Chat."*

Moscow---The Russian government made a diplomatic breakthrough on the current Syrian crisis today, formally clamping down on President Bashar Al-Assad's overzealous, toxic sharing of sensitive Instagram photos. Until recently, Syria would infrequently Instagram Al-Assad smiling with babies and hugging schoolchildren. Since the escalation of sectarian violence, Syria's official Instagram feed has been rapidly, inexplicably replaced with far less prosaic pictures; examples include X-Pro'd VX rockets and several graphic shots of rebels dying from Soviet-era mustard gas.

"Now, now, that's a bold implication without any real evidence. The Lo-Fi filter is probably making it look more Soviet-esque, don't you think?" forcefully clarified Russian President Vladimir Putin, a former KGB spook/expert on Soviet-era chemical agents. In his official statement, Putin retold his own country's struggle with the addictive, poisonous power of social media sharing, and how both Russia and the US have established detente through transparency and trust. Today, thanks to the SWAG-II treaty, only a limited number of Instagram volleys are allowed between superpowers, with each (kilo)gram of President Obama swigging a pint of beer counterbalanced by a shirtless President Putin riding a bear.

But these controls weren't in place with Syria, as it patently refused to participate in both SWAG-I and SWAG-II (some blame Bashar's myopic, selfish tendency to overshare). Fearing a potentially cataclysmic shift in social media balance, Russia independently brokered a deal with Syria and likely prevented a US/Poland coalition from sending a Tomahawk missile directly into Bashar Al-Assad's iPhone 4s.

"All in all, we think it's a pretty big victory for the Middle East. No matter what though,  I really need to talk Bashar into downloading Snapchat. He just doesn't get privacy," admitted Putin.

In related news, China made a separate statement on the crisis, reiterating that it would never stop the flow of Syrian posts on Sina Weibo or Chinese-made chemical weapons into Syria.
