London, UK---Startling news from the Conference for Investigative Journalism today, as whistle blower William Binney revealed that the National Security Agency records 80% of all phone calls and taps dozens of graves---including George Washington's and George Orwell's---to confirm their occupants are in a state of continuous spin. "This is insanity," commented Edward Snowden, whose corpse will undoubtedly be under NSA surveillance soon. 

For years, experts speculated that the NSA had the technological know-how to engage in "Grave-Spin-Detection," as it's known in the intelligence community. But few could comprehend the scale of their effort. "There were the usual suspects---writers critical of authoritarian regimes, philosophers, and so on," noted Binney. "But there are dozens of graves where the value of spin detection is questionable at best. Former Defense contractor CEOs, members of the Bush-Cheney administration, etc. Why bother?"

"Operation Spin Machine," as the NSA calls their far-reaching grave invasion policy, has existed in some state for decades, but only recently has the NSA targeted the corpses of American citizens, including, most prominently, the Founding Fathers. Soon, the program will expand by utilizing Constitution-seeking Predator drones, which will automatically disintegrate copies of America's foundational document with an enhanced-flammability dogshit/napalm mixture.

While the NSA hasn't officially commented on the matter, several sources confirm that almost every Founding Father is spinning in their grave---how this information helps America fight its enemies remains unclear.
