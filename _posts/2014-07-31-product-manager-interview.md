*Suggestions on hiring PMs from someone trying to suck less at PM-ing*

Note: this is actually not satire. Yes, really. If it reads that way, it's completely unintentional (whoops). Legit advice intended.

Recently, an engineer friend of mine was slated to interview a product manager, and decided to ask me for some thoughts. I've been a PM at a few places and occupied something of a superset of that role at my prior startup, so I was happy to oblige. Turns out he thought it was pretty useful, and encouraged me to take my email and turn it into a blog post. So here are some of the juicier nuggets of that email.

From the engineering perspective, there are three main traits that matter greatly when it comes to a PM, and they're all about helping make your job easier---but can easily make your job a metric shit-ton harder.

The reason being: on an org chart, PMs are generally considered "orthogonal" to engineers, but in reality they tend to occupy a superior authority from time to time (which, as a PM, I happen to think is bullshit, but it's just the way upper management likes the cookie to crumble). From your perspective then, it's imperative that you have a PM that you wouldn't mind bossing over you.

Consequently, these three traits (in my mind) define how much an engineer can trust a PM as an arbiter, spec-writer, and more. Here's how I list them out:

Tech chops: Ideally, your PM knows his/her shit when it comes to their tech stack. They don't have to build things, but the more they know about how all the pieces fit together, high level advantages of particular tech, etc. the better off you're going to be. This is all about their ability to empathize with your position, which is very important when...

Communication ability: ...they need to tell everyone's superiors how the product is coming along or communicate delays. The last thing you want: you tell them "this could take 1 week with massive technical debt but 3 weeks to do it right," and then they say to their (or worse, your) boss, "it will take 1 week." They need to be able to articulate all positions clearly and effectively and not lose anything in translation.

Judgment: Finally, you want to have faith in the product they're attempting to build and their ability to make decisions, both tactically and strategically. Even if you disagree with their particular position, you should at least be able to appreciate the process in which they arrived to their particular conclusion.

So what does this mean when it comes to interview questions? Check out these sweet question-bombs, some of which were recently dropped on me by other engineers:

On tech:

* Give me an example of a product you built and how your team built. What were the advantages/disadvantages of that path, and how would you have done things differently?
* Here's our tech stack...have you/teams you worked with ever built anything with it before?
* What's your HN score and do you have a github account I could check out? (just kidding on this one...kinda)

On communication:

* Tell me about a time a deadline slipped and how you handled it.
* Let's say you have to ship a mission-critical feature, and it will take either 1 week with known technical debt or 3 weeks without it. There might be revenue that you lose if you don't get it done in a week. What do you chose to do and why? What would you do to help you make that decision?
* Tell me about a major success you had on a product you worked on, and why it was successful. Ditto for a time that was less than successful.

On judgment:

* Tell me about a product you worked on where you may have changed course due to engineering, design, or business considerations. What made you change your mind about the feature/product and how did you deal with that in the context of the group?
* Have you ever been in a position where you disagreed strongly with a boss or authority? What happened, and how did the situation resolve itself?
* Tell me the best and worst product out right now on X (where X=mobile app, social ad retargeting, ride-sharing, VC-product-flavor-of-the-month, Yo, etc.) and why you think so.

Alright, that's all I got...to be honest, I don't think the interview will tease these traits out as much as interviewing THEIR former colleagues would, but this should at least help you understand their thinking.
