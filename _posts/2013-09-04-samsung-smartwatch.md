title: Samsung Announces Worthless Smartwatch, Lawsuit Against Apple's Nonexistent, Worthwhile Smartwatch
---

*"Look, I'll be honest, this thing's pretty much just a patent play against Apple" says Samsung CEO*

New York, NY -- In a not entirely unprecedented move, Samsung announced a horseshit product with negligible consumer value and massive litigious upside. Today, they unveiled the "Galaxy Gear," a smartwatch that Dick Tracy would characterize as "wrist-waste," alongside a meticulously designed lawsuit against Apple and their (as yet completely imaginary) smartwatch.

At the event, Samsung spent 3 minutes and 28 seconds on the "Gear," and 96 minutes detailing their plans to leverage their shoddy timepiece against Apple. The event concluded with an inexplicable 5 minute "comedy" sketch of a Samsung SVP repeatedly kicking a Jony Ive-look-alike in the testicles; testicles which, unfortunately for Samsung, were markedly tougher than the fragile, now-broken "Galaxy Gear" he was wearing on his ankle.

Numerous Samsung representatives were on hand to deflect questions about the "Gear" and answer unasked questions about their pending legal action. Explained one clearly disaffected rep: "Yeah, it has a screen, a camera for some reason, and some other incomprehensible bullshit. If you shake it in a ‘jerk-off' motion it will occasionally tell you the time, if there's still any battery left. But enough about that -- did you know the smartwatch market could be worth billions of dollars? And whoever controls the patents/prior art controls the market? Because we sure do!"

The representative proceeded to demonstrate the delivery mechanism for their formal legal complaint to Apple: a manilla envelope, addressed to 1 Infinite Loop, containing a hollowed-out MacBook Air filled with legal documentation. "We figured the skeuomorphic-double-take would add a nice ‘fuck you Apple' touch," he claimed with a wry smile.

Apple was curt with its response. "We have some magical products coming up, and Apple has no doubt that the legal system will permit consumers to choose the products they want," said Apple CEO Tim Cook.

After a short pause, he continued: "Failing that, we here at Apple would like to remind any potential competitors that we do, in fact, own the patent for an all-encompassing concept of Time. So, you know. Take some time before acting. This time...it's free. But only this time. Next time will cost you." Apple's CEO stole a brief glance at the painting behind him, a reproduction of Dali's ‘The Persistence of Memory.' He seemed satisfied, then ended the press conference in a fit of maniacal laughter.
