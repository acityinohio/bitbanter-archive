title: American Health Insurance Companies Unveil New "Kill Yourself" Incentive Program
---

*Program will save US citizens from excessive medical costs, existential despair*

San Diego, CA -- An industry consortium calling itself the "Promote Death Panel" announced the program to fanfare and positive reviews. "Death is a big problem in the American health system," explained Dan Davidson, PDP's President and Chief Euthanizer. "There's just not enough of it. Turns out that citizens can save tens of thousands of dollars over their lifetimes by simply cutting them short. Reduced stress and freedom from mortal commitments are nice bonuses." 

Already, the program is oversubscribed, as millions of jobless college graduates finally discover a method to create economic value. 83% of program respondents say they'll use incentive funds to partially pay down their debts, enabling financial solvency for their parents' retirement accounts. Another 10% plan to use program money to pay down their childrens' student loans. The final 7% suggested that their more annoying family members "would greatly benefit from this innovative new program."
