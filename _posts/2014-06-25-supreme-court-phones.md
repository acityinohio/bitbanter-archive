Washington, D.C.---After deliberation, we at the Court quickly---and unanimously---decided that warrants are absolutely required for phone searches, upholding Constitutional protections while tacitly recognizing that all the worthwhile information is on easily accessible, NSA-backdoored cloud-based services. We expect that Americans will applaud this decision, and rightfully so. 

Originally, the Court had a fair amount of dissent. We're not what you'd call "technologically savvy," or "aware of technology outside of the fax machines we use to shuffle opinions back and forth." Consequently, many of us thought this ruling would prove quite a challenge. Luckily, early into deliberations, we received a [redacted] from NSA advocate [redacted] that explained the issue with remarkable clarity. Once we understood that 99% of users' data resides on these mythical "cloud servers"---and not their actual phones---the ruling became significantly easier.

Simply put, if Martians were to come to Earth, they'd be forgiven if they assumed that phones were a natural extension of our anatomy, given our attachment to the little devices. And like any part of our anatomy, it should be cataloged and identified in a national database for security reasons. But thankfully, because the real "meat and bones" of our cellular appendages actually live "in the cloud," we can safely say we'll never search citizens' phones without a warrant while totally---and continuously---patting down their phantom-cloud-limb.

Founders vision maintained? Check. Alarmist and increasingly powerful intelligence interests pleased? Check. Legally speaking, we're on Cloud 9, and it's been thoroughly searched without consent. You're welcome, America.
