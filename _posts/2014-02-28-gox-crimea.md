title: "Bankrupt Mt.Gox Reveals Location of Lost Private Keys: F*#@ing Crimea"
---

*"Gosh guys I just can't believe our bad luck here," claims CEO with shit-eating grin*

Tokyo, Japan---At an announcement during bankruptcy proceedings today, the embattled bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox revealed that it finally located a private key with access to the 850,000 bitcoin it supposedly lost. Unsurprisingly, the key was conveniently lost in the midst of a chaotic, unpredictable conflict that would make retrieving it nigh impossible. "Of all the crazy coincidences, am I right?" asked CEO Mark Karpeles to the Tokyo District Court. "I assure you this is the third to last time I ever do any business in Eastern Europe."

Supposedly, Mt.Gox kept most of its customers' bitcoin in "cold storage," a euphemism for keeping them disconnected from computer hardware, and in this case, storing said bitcoin in a locale that was also quite chilly. Court documents show that the private key for an address with access to 850,000 BTC was hastily scrawled onto the back of a Starbucks receipt and sent to a "cold storage solution provider" known as "Crimea of the Century," a now defunct entity named for its apparent ability to store precious documents for decades. Since the breakout of hostilities in the region, no one can stipulate what has happened to Crimea of the Century, although Karpeles has been quick to speculate.

"The key is long gone everyone. And just when we fixed that nasty bug with the bitcoin protocol!" Mt.Gox's CEO sighed heavily at the weight of his supposition. "Even worse, someone in Crimea may have simply run off with the key. Can you believe the nerve? Of someone who would defraud so many people wholesale? That their greedy actions could mean the death blow for an embryonic currency that would have otherwise fundamentally altered the world in an uncountable number of positive ways?" Karpeles pleaded to the court, his eyes watery but his smile unchanged.

"I offer my sincerest apologies. Had I known about this malfeasance, I would have never committed [to] the Crimea of the Century \[group\]."

Mt.Gox's CEO has since recused himself from the court, saying he had urgent business in Eastern Europe.
