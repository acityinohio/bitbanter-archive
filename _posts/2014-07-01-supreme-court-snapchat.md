*All decisions voided after 24 hours*

Washington, D.C.---In a rare display of bold bipartisan action, Congress passed a sweeping amendment to the Constitution that will fundamentally alter legal doctrine in America. "Ultimately, neither party has been particularly pleased with recent Supreme Court decisions. Combined with the snail-like pace of our legal process, we had to act, or risk America falling behind," said Speaker John Boehner. The solution, Boehner noted, was to remove barriers preventing quick legal decisions while ensuring the ephemerality of legal precedent. "Thus, all bad decisions are voided in 24 hours," added a smiling Boehner, tacitly assuming that every decision made by our legal system is, in fact, a bad one.

The effects of the amendment are drastic and immediate. After receiving a case, all Supreme Court decisions must be made within 24 hours. Justices have a "Tinder-like" interface through their smartphones to vote, while briefs---and opinions---are limited to 140 characters to accommodate full-scale Twitter integration with our legal system. Most radically, the decisions themselves are only effective for 24 hours---whereupon the precedent is permanently purged from America's legal tradition.

"America's legal system was painfully slow and deliberate, completely bereft of the last century's incredible technological progress," noted CATO Institute Fellow James Stinson. "Now America's judicial branch will leapfrog the rest of the Western World's---arbitrary decisions are now reversed in days instead of decades. That's progress!"

Not everyone is excited, however. With laws being overturned every 24 hours, some civil liberty groups are concerned that American citizens may unwittingly engage in unlawful behavior. Anticipating their concerns, the government is working to keep Joe Plumber on the right side of the ever-changing law. Thanks to a breakthrough collaboration between Google and the NSA, American citizens will receive push notifications when their smartphones intelligently detect if they're breaking the law (as it stands in that moment). Citizens will have ten seconds to disengage in illegal activity before armed drones are sent to their phone-provided GPS coordinates. Google could not be reached for comment, only stating that "this was the first they've heard of any collaboration with the NSA."

The Justices themselves are cautiously excited about the change. "I can still fax my Tweetpinions in, right?" asked a confused Chief Justice Roberts in a non-televised, non-audio-recorded press conference.
