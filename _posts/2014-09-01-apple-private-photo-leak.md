Cupertino and Los Angeles, CA---Today Apple admitted to a soft-launch of a new product just a week before their special event on September 9th, and it already has Google, Samsung, and the Screen Actors' Guild worried. "We call it Find Celebrities' Private Photos," admitted Apple Tim Cook in an unscheduled press conference. "All of our customers have been clamoring for new ways to engage with famous people using iPhones, and boy did we find a way to knock this one out of the park."

Here's how it works: install the latest iOS update, which includes a new app called "Find Celebrities' Private Photos." Click on the app, and it will open a redirected Safari page to 4chan's /b/ message board, along with a pre-filled post that offers bitcoins for private celebrity photos. Eventually, someone on the Internet will use an exploit in Apple's "Find my iPhone" feature to brute-force a celebrity's password, after which they will post all of the celebrity's photos saved in iCloud. "It's the simplest, most magical way to invade the private lives of the people you wish loved you," claims Cook.

In addition to the expected outrage from people using cloud storage services to store naked pictures of themselves, a number of voices in the technology community are calling this a "hack" and "an egregious extension of Apple's Reality Distortion Field."

In response, Apple released a strong denial, alongside the private iMessage logs of the dissenting tech luminaries in question.
