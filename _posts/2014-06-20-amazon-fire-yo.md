Seattle, WA---In a private event this week, Amazon finally unveiled their oft-rumored smartphone, the Fire Phone. Citing its "magical no-glasses 3D display, streamlined Amazon purchasing functionality, and deep, OS-level Yo integration," Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was on Fire during the presentation, exciting the normally placid tech press to new levels of hyperbole.

"In ten years, when you look up the term 'Game Changer' in your Kindle dictionary, you're going to see a 3D picture of the Fire Phone," said tech journalist Walt Mossberg. "Here are the only reasons I leave the house: to experience three dimensions, to compare retail prices with Amazon before inevitably purchasing through Amazon, and to say 'yo' to everyone I know. This phone is going to dramatically simplify my life."

After delicately caressing his Fire Phone, Mossberg added, "And words can't describe how excited I am to sign up for another two year contract with America's favorite wireless company, the Fire Phone's exclusive provider---and Recode.net sponsor---AT&T. This is such a slam dunk."

While most of the tech blogosphere widely expected the 3D display, almost all were shocked at the inclusion of deep Yo integration, an inexplicably popular smartphone app released but days ago. The app is the simplest way to send the word "Yo" to anyone on your contact list. The creators of the app call it "a disaggregated Facebook Poke platform, but 50% shorter." Bezos said they have been planning the integration for years, calling Yo "the next great social platform of our age---it's the Turntable.FM of not-music." Bezos quickly added that the Fire Phone will be the only platform to receive Yo in "eye-popping 3D."

Unfortunately, all of this innovation doesn't come cheap; Amazon Prime's price has been raised to $199 to support Yo integration across Amazon's platform, and to subsidize the addition of "dozens" of public-domain videos and music to Amazon's streaming services. But Bezos thinks the price hike is easily justified.

"People will love the value here," he said. "Within weeks, we expect 90% of Amazon Prime members to have purchased the Fire Phone.

"...and if they don't, we'll probably make using one a requirement for two-day shipping."
