title: Combined Comcast/Time Warner to Rebrand as "Mephistopheles, Destroyer of Worlds"
---

*"All shall tremble before our insatiable power and consumer-friendly synergy," claims SVP*

New York, NYC -- In a broadcast that interrupted all Internet, phone, and television transmissions to Comcast/TWC's combined subscriber base of 30 million, Comcast's SVP of Public Relations/Chief Archon of the Destroyer announced sweeping changes to the soon-to-be-formed telecom giant.

"Make no attempt to ignore the Voice of the Destroyer; thanks to our competitive and convenient Triple Play bundles of voice/cable/Internet, ye mortals cannot escape our missive," started Chief Archon Brandenburg, wearing an Armani-designed Robe of the Bloodied. Flames licked his cheeks, and as his eyes glowed magma-red, he continued, "We are no longer the fragmented shadows We once were. Our once-shattered soul has entered the Final Covenant, and post-merger, Comcast/TWC shall spill forth from its chrysalis like a moth from a behemoth cocoon. The world shall stand frozen before Mephistopheles, Master Destroyer, Bringer of Oblivion and Harbinger of DOOM!"

"...after productive conversations with the FTC, FCC, and a dozen other government agencies of course. Consumer protection is the Harbinger's highest priority." Archon Brandenburg quickly dissolved into a towering spire of flame and vampire bats, his mad cackling echoing through the computers and television screens of millions.

Unsurprisingly, response to the announcement has been mixed. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Wikipedia, and the Catholic Church have all quickly condemned the possible return of a Prime Evil once thought vanquished. Government agencies and the White House have been cautious but upbeat. When asked for comment, President Obama reiterated the need for pragmatism: "Look, despite what the media might claim, I don't think it's a Faustian bargain. With Mephistopheles' scale, It could bring ‘last mile' broadband to millions of Americans. That said, some stipulations of the merger must change. The idea that ‘Blood of Unsullied First Borns' could replace the US dollar for cable bills is worrisome. Mephistopheles or not, the government cannot lose control of fiscal policy." While follow-up questions were asked, Obama had to quickly excuse himself to "check with White House General Counsel about a very, very old contract."

Post-merger, analysts and priests expect a restructuring that could reduce headcount at Mephistopheles by 30%, which doesn't even include low-level employees who will be ritualistically beheaded for committing egregious sins against the Prime Evil (by not hard-selling the goddamned Triple Play bundle like they're told). Net neutrality will become a thing of the past; access to Netflix or Youtube will be impossible without sacrificing something precious to the Harbinger. Meanwhile, the general public will be compelled to watch NBC's MUST SEE OR FACE THE WRATH OF OBLIVION TV, broadcast directly into the inner eyelids of believers and unbelievers alike. Advertisements will burn into the collective consciousness like the Unquenchable Flames of Mephistopheles' Molten Heart, and consumers will never unsee the horror (nor can they skip ads, but Mephistopheles promises fantastic deals at your local car dealership).

While opposition still exists to the merger, Proto-Mephistopheles remains unconcerned. As voiced through the Chief Archon: "Fools! This isn't even my final form. Comcast is also thinking of acquiring AT&amp;T."
