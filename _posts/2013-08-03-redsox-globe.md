title: Red Sox Owner Buys Boston Globe, Creating Globe's Last Relevant Headline
---

*Reorganization underway to make final meaningful article "a solid triple"*

Boston, MA -- The Boston Globe is preparing to enter a whole new ball game, as its ownership transitions from the New York Times to the no-longer-business-savvy reigns of Red Sox owner John Henry. While newspapers aren't exactly Henry's wheelhouse, he's seemingly unworried. "It ain't over â€˜til it's over!" exclaimed the principal owner of the Red Sox, demonstrating both the down-to-Earth tenacity and complete ignorance of fundamentals his team makes famous on a yearly basis.

Henry shared his bold vision to a Boston Globe reporter, who was subsequently told to post his findings into a tightly controlled, paywalled article. "This isn't really a hail mary. Mainly because we're not talking about football. No, this is more like a swing for the fences right after the 7th inning stretch." Henry's plan is simple: the Globe will pin its hopes on its last relevant, self-referential article about its forthcoming purchase. While this would normally be a commodity news item worth $120 from AP or Reuters, Henry believes that extraordinary measures will recoup his investment.

Already, 99% of the staff has been fired, while the remaining reporter and IT employee now have a daily quota of 3 baseball idioms per meeting. Those fired reportedly struck out swinging while grandstanding, but they were all a metaphor short of keeping their jobs.

Despite these grand changes and Henry's bold plan, not all experts are behind him. "You're reading about the deal from another source. Would you even go to another article after this? That's like staying past the 4th inning at a Red Sox game," stated pretty much everyone.

Still, even in the worst case, Henry thinks he has his bases covered. The $70 million deal reportedly included about $3.50 in cash, while the rest was in peanuts and cracker jacks. "Honestly, I don't even care if I ever get that money back."
