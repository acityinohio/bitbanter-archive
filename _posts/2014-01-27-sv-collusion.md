title: Silicon Valley Engineers Accidentally Conspire to Reduce CEO Wages by Not Really Working Most of the Time
---

*"They pay me to work 10 hours a week, so that's exactly what I do," says every engineer in the Valley*

Silicon Valley, CA---What began as a decade-long anticompetitive gentleman's agreement amongst America's highest profile tech companies to artificially reduce employee salaries has taken a surprising turn this week. New revelations show that millions of engineers have (unknowingly) colluded to reduce stock prices---and consequently, stock-heavy CEO pay packages---by simply not working most of the time. Officials at the Justice Department are unsure how to proceed; in addition to this being the first case of an "organic, unorchestrated cartel," records indicate that this behavior has manifested itself since the early days of Fairchild Semiconductor.

In tens of thousands of documents, ranging from internal paper memos many decades ago to Git commit messages just last week, the Justice Department has discovered a distinct, albeit completely uncoordinated pattern of "natural collusion." Generations ago, records indicate that engineers would "push back" on managers' estimates and claim easy projects were "impossibly difficult." Today, engineers sporadically log on to chat services and make one insightful comment/code commit every few hours to maintain an appearance of full day's work. Still others create elaborate "WFH" schemes to fool even the most diligent of overseers; the Justice Department is scrambling to understand what that acronym could possibly mean, and has collaborated with top NSA engineers to decipher its meaning (although internal leaked memos suggest that the NSA engineers are finding the task "dreadfully difficult---impossible even").

Some are calling for an unprecedented reverse class action suit against technology workers, although it's worth noting that "some" in this case is almost unilaterally CEOs and a scattered number of luddite Tea Partiers. Others feel it's a relatively fair arrangement. Said one anonymous operations engineer at Google, "You mean Eric Schmidt is worth $9 billion instead of $12 billion? I'm okay with that...wait, he's worth $9 billion? And I've been denied an appropriate market-level raise for the last 6 years? HOW IS THAT FAIR? Man fuck this, I'm WFH today. I'll be on my cell...every couple of hours. If gmail goes down, Eric can deal with it."

We have reached out to dozens of engineers across the Valley, and they invariably responded the same way: "Let me get back to you on that, stuck on a really big problem right now. Earliest I can get you a deliverable is next week. Sorry."

Meanwhile, at the 16th St/Mission BART station in San Francisco, a member of the lowest quintile of America's socioeconomic classes played a hauntingly melancholic fugue on the smallest violin ever made in support of CEOs and engineers alike. He has received no tips, and likely never will.
