Seattle, WA---Steve Ballmer announced today that he purchased the embattled Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion, mainly because he "missed the toxic culture that surrounded [him] during [his] tenure as CEO of Microsoft." In a press conference, Ballmer admitted to pining for a role in a "stagnating organization," rife with "petty turf battles" and "a spectrum of HR violations." Ballmer claimed the Clippers represents an investment in equal parts mediocre management and complacent success rivaled only by "Microsoft of the late aughts," and he had to jump on the opportunity.

According to Ballmer, Clippers fans needn't fear about changes to the organization, or worry about losing that sad sense of discordant ennui that pervades the Staples Center on game night. Just as Ballmer steered Microsoft into a monopolistic software titan of questionable relevance, so too will he shape the successful Clippers into irrelevant victors, a lost footnote amongst the pages of sports history.

Similar to his time at Microsoft, he plans subtle changes that are mostly cosmetic in nature. For example, former owner Don Sterling won't actually be fully replaced---instead, he will be given a lifetime seat behind the visitor bench, where he will be contractually obligated to whisper racial epithets into the opposing teams' ears. Ballmer also plans on changing the overall design motif of the Clippers to "LA Metro" without advance warning to anyone within the organization who is most materially affected by the change.

Moreover, the Clippers mascot will be replaced by Clippy, everyone's favorite anthropomorphic paper-clip. From time to time, Clippy will offer helpful hints to Clippers players: e.g., "Looks like you're trying to make a free throw---any way I can help?" A surcharge for Clippy's services will be automatically added to every Clippers ticket, but fans can mitigate the increase by purchasing tickets through Bing, if they can figure out how. When asked why Clippy was necessary, Ballmer responded: "Look, you have to understand here, everything I'm doing now is about the players. Players. Players. Players. Players. Players. Players. PLAYERS. PLAYERS. PLAYERS. PLAYERS. PLAYERS. PLAYERS. PLAYERS."

Ballmer said he was incredibly excited about owning the team, and looks forward to killing the team through a thousand cuts. "Can't wait to lead the LA Clippers during their most exciting chapter yet!" tweeted Ballmer, from Seattle, using Twitter for iPhone.
