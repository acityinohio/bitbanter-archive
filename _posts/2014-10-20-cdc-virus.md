*Virus repeatedly escapes containment on CDC's predominantly Windows XP-based network*

Atlanta, GA---After weeks of questions surrounding the Center for Disease Control's lackluster efforts against Ebola, the Federal agency has confirmed critics' worst fears: a rogue computer virus has infected all levels of CDC technological infrastructure, hemorrhaging the Center's already strained resources. "Roughly 50% of our machines are dead in the water," claimed the CDC's Head of Communications via AOL Instant Messenger.

In a faxed press release, CDC Director Tom Frieden outlined the state of the current crisis:

* Cyber-security researchers identified the virus as "3.801A," a strain of computer malware that originated in early versions of South African Ubuntu but platform-jumped to Windows XP.
* The virus rarely thrives in modern computers/networks, except in cases of gross incompetence or aging technology deployments.
* The circumstances behind 3.801A's infiltration into the CDC remains a mystery; the best hypothesis is that a Systems Administrator neglected proper quarantine procedures after visiting BuzzFeed through IE6.
* The CDC has redoubled its efforts to contain the technological pandemic, and has disconnected external access to the CDC intranet and upgraded all its non-infected computers to Windows XP Service Pack 3.

Some security researchers say it won't be enough. "Already, we're seeing resurgences of 3.801A in other government networks, and not just through email transmission vectors. Yes, we know the virus spreads through a LotusNotes email attachment titled 'URGENT---EBOLA REACHING PANDEMIC GROWTH THRESHOLD,' but many of these networks don't even have clients with email capabilities. I've even heard rumors of transmission through OS X's AirDrop file-sharing protocol. We could have a real nuisance if this sucker goes AirDrop-borne," said a head researcher at Symantec, who later admitted he was heavily incentivized to fearmonger worst-case 3.801A scenarios.

In a rare moment of transparency, the CDC offered a unorthodox solution to the crisis in a FedExed over-head-projector slide. "We can't contain viral growth," wrote Frieden, "but what if that was actually a strength in a new CDC? That's why we're pivoting into the Creative Data Consortium, the world's premiere Viral Marketing Agency. We'll spread your message faster and farther than the Spanish Flu." At press time, the rebranded Creative Data Consortium has already raised a $25 million seed round from Mark Zuckerberg.

President Obama was reportedly displeased when he received his own OHP transparency several days later, but will not unseat Director Frieden. Instead, he appointed CNN correspondent Sanjay Gupta---a media personality and career doctor with no technology experience---to the newly created position of CDC Information Technology Czar.
