*Company cleverly rebrands "stealing ideas" as "resharing"*

Menlo Park, CA -- Facebook unveiled a "completely innovative" and "beautiful" way to reappropriate ideas today, as the company recycled the fundamental concepts behind Vine and mashed them into Instagram.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained: "For years, we struggled with communicating the way we wholesale copy ideas. Whether it was mobile messaging, maps, app stores, Facebook credits, intrusive ad retargeting, or soon-to-be-acquired FourSquare, we had trouble properly explaining to our customers that stealing ideas was okay." Mark paused awkwardly for what seemed like days, but was actually only hours. "You see, the branding solution was in front of us all along. We aren't copying. We're resharing."

In its official press release, Facebook went on to explain that the poorly monikered Zuckerberg's Law (that sharing will increase exponentially, like a Moore's Law for lolcats) has also applied to "resharing" (what Facebook is now calling idea-stealing). Facebook claimed that resharing will become the growth engine of the "shareconomy," and reshared ideas will outnumber original, novel thought for decades to come.

Marketing experts are divided on this bold move, but all seem to agree that rebranding concept-theft as "resharing" remains Facebook's first, and only, original idea.
