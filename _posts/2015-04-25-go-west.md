*There's cryptocurrency in them idyllic SF hills*

I'm writing this some 35,000 feet up, careening 500mph in the air, balanced precariously between pockets of atmosphere. Though I have long satirized modern technology, I have longer been in awe of it. Volumes have been written about the fact that anyone can communicate with rest of the world in any number of ways while disconnected from the Earth's surface by 7 miles of air...so I won't focus on that point. But still, wow.

In this moment of in-flight reflection, I'm struck by how much technology continues to amaze me. My love affair began when I figured out how to muddle through MS-DOS 3.1 as a curious (and electronically destructive) four-year-old. Needless to say, in those halcyon days of "needing to do a lot of work" to make a computer functional, I was frustrated, then obsessed, then frustrated, then obsessed, ad infinitum. It was like running [Gentoo](http://gentoo.org/) all the time. I was instantly hooked.

While I have pursued other passions---including, but not limited to: writing, satire, comedy, physics, astronomy, political philosophy, math, making lists of my passions---computing technology has captured my imagination and inspired me since I can remember first remembering.

It is fitting, then, that I move (back) to San Francisco.

To those I didn't manage to see before I left: apologies for the sudden "ghosting." I assure you I'll be back east/southwest to visit, as nearly half my friends and damn near all my family is there. Just as I came back to DC for good reasons (health, being near family post back-wrecking surgery) I'm moving back west for good reason: to help advocate for a fantastic company building a future for cryptocurrency. In a week I'll be joining [BlockCypher](https://blockcypher.com/) as their Developer Advocate, which means I get to promote a platform/technology I love alongside a top-notch team through technical writing, presentations, and all manner of edutainment-filled activities.

Many of you have known that I have been bitcoin and cryptocurrency-obsessed for quite some time; hell, two years ago, this website was a bitcoin side-project before I turned it into my blog. If you ever saw me at a party over the last few years, you'd know that I typically spend my time sharing my love of cryptocurrency to anyone in earshot (and consequently, would frequently get disinvited to future parties).

Miraculously, I found a job where I get to do that all the time. For a living.

According to my definition of partying, I found a job where I get to party all the time. I'd be really hard-pressed to find a more perfect fit. Not to mention that so many of my friends have found themselves attracted to the technological talent singularity that is the Bay Area. But to everyone else not in the Bay: come visit, it's practically paradise out here. And to folks interested in building stuff with blockchains: hit me up on [Twitterverse](https://twitter.com/acityinohio), I'm here to help.

Here's to starting a new chapter...actually, scratch that staid startup-chapter-metaphor. Here's to finding a helluva [golden nonce](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Nonce) and adding my own block to cryptocurrency's proverbial chain. :)
