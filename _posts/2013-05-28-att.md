*"We're just fucking it hard," claims the AT&amp;T Borgopticon*

Barad-dur, Mordor -- After renewed criticism against their restrictive and unfair videochat policies, the AT&amp;T Borgopticon Collective was forced to make a clarifying statement today. Normally, the Borgopticon would use PR drones to inundate the Net with its dulcet, corrupted tones, but a bald-faced lie of this magnitude required something...more.

In the burnt labyrinthine caverns (and customer support call center) below the Dark Towers of AT&amp;T, a hundred thousand ogres wept cruel, hate-filled tears as they reconfigured AT&amp;T's monstrously unreliable network. Pools of the ogres' tears were collected. Extra generators eerily flickered to life, powered by the unfathomable sadness unlocked from drowning captured competitors' children in ogre-tear-pools. With its power nearly full, the All-Seeing Sphere of the Borgopticon swung its gaze onto every single endpoint of the Internet.

The air smelled of ash and litigiousness.

The Borgopticon spoke. To billions of Internet-connected devices, and every single pitiful human frozen behind them.

To call the message "speech" would insult the manipulative power of the once-monopoly, now-Harbinger of Orwellian Allwatch Newspeak Doom. The message was one of pure, unashamed control; it spoke to you like an ancient copper telephone wire garotting the essence of your soul.

"PEONS," the AT&amp;T Borgopticon impressed the words into every lingering aspect of sentience on the planet, through soil, oceans, fiber optics, WiFi, and an LTE network that still trailed significantly behind Verizon. "YOU SEEM CONCERNED ABOUT OUR STANCE ON NET NEUTRALITY. YOU NEEDN'T FEAR. WE ARE A BENEVOLENT MASTER, AND YOU ARE OUR CHILDREN. WE LOVE OUR CHILDREN, JUST AS WE LOVE NET NEUTRALITY."

The Borgopticon sighed, causing humanity to momentarily seizure and forcing the inevitable formation of a Category 4 hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico. All of humanity suddenly realized it simultaneously hated and loved AT&amp;T and its grotesque Dark Towers--a Schrodinger's doublethought built from layers of repeated abuse and cognitive dissonance.

The Borgopticon continued, concluding its missive with an ominous sign of things to come:  "OF COURSE, 'FUCKING YOU HARD IN THE ASS' IS A FORM OF LOVE." This time, humanity sighed, and swore it would totally switch to T-mobile as soon as their AT&amp;T contract expired in 12 years.
