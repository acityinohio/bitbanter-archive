*Bureaucratic decision-making has compromised compromise*

Troubling news today, as the Lenovo corporation---a major computer manufacturer---was revealed to be the target of a massive Man-in-Middle-Management (MIMM) attack. "I've never seen anything of this scale before," said Bruce Schneier, one of the world's leading security specialists. "The only example that comes close is last decade's Sony C-Level Rootkit; their CEO was replaced with a sophisticated British robot. But this breach is quite a bit more nefarious. It's been hiding in the depths of Lenovo's corporate belly and---remarkably---is not the direct fault of any single person at Lenovo."

The attack, which has been dubbed "Superphishing the Managers," is straightforward, if subtle. Imagine the Lenovo corporation as a hierarchy of people who are paid to respond to emails. The graph below is a simplified, if representative, distribution of pay vs email-response-rate.

Within Lenovo (and many other organizations), the higher one's pay and responsibility, the less responsive they are. This is by design; the CEO/CTO can only be bothered to respond to priority messages, for example. The further down you go in the hierarchy, the more responsive employees become.

In an idealized world, the graph above would be smooth. But we don't live in an ideal world, of perfect security, or corporate hierarchy---hence the step-change difference between certain pay levels and response rates.

Therein lies the security vulnerability. Imagine you're a Director of Business Development at Lenovo, with three bosses above you and a dozen direct reports below you. You're new to the position, and haven't adjusted to ignoring emails. Eager to prove yourself, you respond to many emails that you shouldn't---like, say, a suggestion from another overeager Business Development Manager at a shady collection firm named Komodia. You all agree it would be a great idea to preinstall certificates that break the Internet's SSL security model onto all the laptops Lenovo manufactures.

This is not a great idea. But no one will tell you otherwise, since, by design, your bosses are paid more to ignore your emails. This is exacerbated by the perceived need to "delegate," wherein your boss has incentivized you to do as many deals as possible, regardless of their content.

Similar patterns exist in other Middle Management positions across Lenovo, which results in a rather strange conclusion: horrible decision making, which would never happen at the top or bottom of the organization. But the top of the organization is paid to ignore the emails of the middle managers, and middle managers are paid to ignore the pleas of the bottom. Observe:

It's no one's fault, and everyone's fault, a veritable Tao of Mismanagement.

What can be done to save Lenovo? Not much, unfortunately. For now, security experts suggest steering clear of Lenovo products, and strongly advise against taking a job at Lenovo.
