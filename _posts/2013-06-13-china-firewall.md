title: China Open Sources Great Firewall to Compete with US PRISM

*Budget-conscious despotic regimes can now "Choose Open to Stay Closed"*

It's crunch time. You're about to covertly obtain an unimaginable amount of your country's material wealth under the guise of a job creation initiative. You've paid off the right people and the wrong people have been silenced. Glory, wealth, and power...the realization of a lifelong dream seems so close.

Until some asshole hacktivist named "TheNigerianPrincess" releases your Hotmail password into the Twitterverse. A couple hundred protests later, your tribe-divided country turns to shambles and even the CIA won't take your calls. You're a few weeks away from having your Presidential oversight relegated to the view from a proper end of a pike atop your former compound.

Where did it all go wrong? Some might point to the CIA. And that's fair, but not the source of the real problem. Your real problem is people. Your people. More specifically, your people's connectivity. Let's talk about the tinder that grants the Promethean flame: the Internet.

Oh sure, the Internet was a boon initially. Some undersea fiber cables, a few wireless monopolies, cheap smartphones and boom! All the sudden you had an opiate of the connected masses. Who needs new schools when children can play Angry Birds instead? They ignored the police brutality, the lack of basic human rights and infrastructure. They no longer cared about massive wealth disparity.

Well, most of them. And that's always the problem, isn't it? Because on the Internet, those crazy ones with "ideals" and "grievances" can snap their kin out of complacency. And they often do.

But how can one combat the seemingly invulnerable hydra of massive connectivity? Why, just follow the hacker ethos, friend. Don't solve a problem that's already been solved! The People's Republic of China has guarded the Chinese Internet since our backdoor into ARPANET. And today, we're open sourcing the technology that keeps our country an immovable island in a sea of dissent. That's right, the very same codebase that powers our Great Firewall can be yours, simply by forking us on Github (assuming you haven't already censored Github).

The Great Firewall is more than just a massive, adaptively learning, multilingual censorship machine. That's just the tip of the Fireberg. That jerkoff hacktivist? Before he even opens Tweetbot, you'd know who he is, his likelihood of dissent, and relative social influence (through our partners at Klout). The Great Firewall can automatically curate a list of probable threats based on extremely accurate (70%+) heuristical reasoning, and they can be neutralized at your leisure. It's like a real-world Minority Report without the pesky precogs or an unbalanced Tom Cruise!

But why open source? The same reason that choosy regimes choose Linux; openness allows a much larger community to discover bugs and exploits that befuddle even a dedicated army of highly trained technicians. Through manufacturing hundreds of millions of Android handsets, China discovered that a policy of open information access catalyzes innovation and improves lives at a pace that rivals traditional capitalism...and even China's own technocratic brand of state-run capitalism. It was a stark discovery, which is why today's China leverages the power of open source to prevent its people from leveraging the power of open source. The last thing China---or you!---wants is open access to dismantle its technocracy.

Worried about integration? Don't be! Even though we provide all the instructions necessary through our Great Firewall Wiki, we'd be happy to send our top consultants to decipher our Mandarin-only instructions and help your ISPs integrate smoothly. Our consultants are free, so long as you agree to meet with a member of the Chinese Politburo to discuss a bilateral natural resource trade agreement; an amazing win-win opportunity in its own right!

So why wait? You could be one tweet away from an African/Latin American Spring. Erase that tweet before it happens. Erect your own Great Firewall, secure your legacy and "Choose Open To Stay Closed!" (tm pending)
