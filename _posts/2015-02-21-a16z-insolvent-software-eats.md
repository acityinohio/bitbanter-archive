Menlo Park, CA---The world's most prominent venture capital firm collapsed under the weight of its own heady prognostications today, as software ate Andreessen Horowitz out of business. "The hard thing about this hard thing: I saw it happening and could do nothing," said partner Ben Horowitz.

Witnesses say software arrived at Andreessen Horowitz's annual "Food from A to Z, All-You-Can-Eat Buffet" fashionably, innocuously late. It stayed under the radar; few registered anything amiss even as the last avocado disappeared. Only a half hour later, when the Zebra Tar Tar plate was surreptitiously empty, were suspicions raised.

"I knew something was wrong when my chair disappeared," said rapper Nas. "I didn't even have One Mic left after that buffet." Other guests were alarmed to discover that software had eaten their cars and phones, leaving them stranded. Only a short time later did the A16Z Managing Partners realize software had destroyed most of their office space, diluted their portfolio equity, and stole their bank accounts. "Software even got our bitcoin private keys, although I guess that's the least surprising disaster in this circus," said A16Z's office manager. Before anyone could stop it, software had already taken a back door out of the buffet, likely intent to crash another.

"Next time I run into software we're going to have a serious talking-to," said partner Marc Andreessen. "You can't keep eating everything. It's irresponsible and disruptive."
