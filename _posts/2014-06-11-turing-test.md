*"I'm a real human being, and a real hero," quotes project leader, through Bayesian inference*

The computer science community was shocked this week when a group at the University of Reading claimed to pass the [Turing Test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) through their algorithm, which faked judges into believing it was a 13-year-old boy named Eugene Goostman. Unfortunately, the team itself did not pass the Turing Test, as evidenced by their willingness to earnestly name an imagined 13-year-old boy Eugene Goostman.

While experts remain divided on the algorithm, they are in definitive agreement that the team itself failed the Turing Test with flying colors, which requires their communication to seem convincingly human. The team leader responded cryptically: "Takes one to know one. :-p"

This is not the first instance that a group of engineers dedicated to making machines seem more human fall short of convincing others they are not themselves machines. According to statistics from the American Academy of Computer Science, a full 87% of artificial intelligence researchers regularly fail the Turing Test.

On this unsurprising development, the head of the Academy's research into AI researchers had this to say: "The meta-irony here rivals Alanis Morrisette's Ironic, if you know what I mean," and we didn't.
