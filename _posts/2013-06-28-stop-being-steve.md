title: "\"Stop Trying To Be Steve Jobs\" Demands Blogger Who\'s Just Like Steve Jobs"

*Apple-loving prick is entitled, condescending asshole*

Macbook Air, Nameless Boutique Coffee Shop, Brooklyn -- Marco Gruber Siegler was having a bad day. "You'd think these bozos could serve a simple single-origin espresso, soy flat white at the right temperature. What a bunch of morons." The MG, as he occasionally calls himself, was in the habit of correcting idiots and it was taking its toll.

According to his blog's about page, The MG has loved Apple products "totally before anyone else, like some kind of ahead-of-his-time product visionary." Now that Apple dominates the technology world, The MG has catapulted into the limelight. From his lofty virtual perch above all other plebeian technologists, The MG regularly dispenses severe admonitions to would-be Jobs pretenders.

"Entrepreneurs get away with saying â€˜I know what people want before they want it' with zero evidence thanks to their faux-Jobsian emulation," wrote The MG, a man who refuses to subject his design or investment decisions to any sort of rigor. "You can't be Steve Jobs. Stop trying. There was, and will only ever be, one Steve Jobs."  In the comments section of his latest post, The MG separately claimed that Siri trumped Google Now, that iOS 7 would revolutionize the whole mobile game, and that Markdown and Tumblr GIFblogs represented the greatest paradigm shift in Internet history since TCP/IP.

Back in the coffee shop, the MG surreptitiously sipped his soy flat white, then less surreptitiously spat it into a struggling barista's face while calling the drink "utter bullshit. Can anyone on this forsaken planet operate a espresso machine with a modicum of fucking common sense?" The MG threw what remained of his drink, cup included, at a wheelchair-bound child before exiting the shop. While he backed out of the shop's only handicap parking spot in his late model, high performance BMW with no license plate, he couldn't help but wonder why the world was filled with no-talent assclowns.
