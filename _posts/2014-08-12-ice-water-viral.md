Atlanta, GA---The Center for Disease Control released a report today warning about the pathogenic spread of self-ice-water-drowning. "While this phenomenon has increased public knowledge about the dangers of hypothermia, it has done so by subjecting much of the public to *actual* hypothermia. The number of hypothermia cases has skyrocketed in the last week and we fear an all-out hypothermia pandemic if nothing is done," said CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden.

As far as the CDC can tell, the phenomenon started at a college campus at a fraternity-sponsored event. Patient Zero almost fully submerged himself in an ice-bath for 10 minutes, recorded the event using his smartphone, then challenged four of his brothers to do the same before dying from exposure a half hour later. The other frat brothers continued this trend before half of them perished, causing an exponential spread that rivals the viral coefficient of the Spanish Flu of 1918. The remarkably high density of social networks on college campuses proved an ideal transmission vector for the disease, despite its astronomical fatality rate of 37%.

The CDC has already initiated quarantine procedures in highly affected areas, mostly by shutting down cellular towers and wired Internet access. They have also begun a large-scale PR campaign, featuring commercials with celebrities to remind citizens that they shouldn't succumb to peer pressure, especially from celebrities.
