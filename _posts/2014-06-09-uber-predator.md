San Francisco, CA---Uber, the darling of Silicon Valley, raised $1.2 billion this past week from In-Q-Tel and an unnamed Saudi prince, valuing the company at a whopping $17 billion. While the funding was widely expected, the purpose of this latest funding round raised more than a few eyebrows.

"It's no longer enough to have the best predictive algorithms, the slickest app design, or the most aggressive marketing. Despite having a best-in-class product, our opponents have kept us embroiled in countless legal disputes, and we're drowning in red tape too thick to cut. But thanks to this latest capital injection and our patented Uber-cleverness, we devised a solution: don't cut the red tape. Blow it up," said CEO/Founder Travis Kalanick, an unabashed supporter of Randian Objectivism. "An entrenched, over-regulated industry is invincible in a courtroom. But all men bleed...or disintegrate, when they're hit with air-to-surface Hellfire missiles."

Uber did not immediately release a target list, citing "operational security needs." But intelligence experts familiar with large-scale, robot-based assassination believe San Francisco and New York-based cabs are top priorities. There have been hints that if the program is successful, Uber will extend their targets to include the taxicab lobbyists, union leaders, legislative supporters, and their families.

While some are excited for Uber's "Final Solution to the Taxi Problem"---as they're marketing it---some are concerned about its long-term feasibility. "Don't get me wrong; I hate traditional taxis as much as the next guy and love Uber's product," said Harvard Business School Professor Tomas Tribly. "But I cannot imagine a scenario where corporate-sponsored assassination of competitors won't face some kind of legal challenge."

Tribly was quick to add, "It's not as if they're doing this in Afghanistan."
