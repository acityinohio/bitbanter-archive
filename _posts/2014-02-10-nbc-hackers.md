title: NBC Producer Lazily Submits Scene from Movie "Hackers" for Latest Piece on Cybercrime
---

*"Russia is like, exactly like this, so why bother sending a crew over there?" justifies producer*

New York, NY---On Sunday, 25-year-old junior news producer Chris Toppleston gave his boss a completely unedited, 5 minute scene from the movie Hackers for his recent assignment on cybercrime in Russia. His superiors asked that Chris---an overworked, underpaid junior producer---come up with a crack piece to "bust this whole Russian hacker thing wide open" in addition to all his normal duties.

Chris, who routinely works 70 hour weeks to assemble innocuous, middle-America-friendly segments on government excess and children winning state fairs, was surprised to be given an assignment of such weight. Given the likelihood that thorough technical explanations would leave the mainstay baby boomer audience scratching their collectively balding heads, Mr. Toppleston decided on a safer approach. By finding an inoffensive, continuous 5 minute clip from the movie "Hackers," Chris offered a segment that felt sophisticated without bogging down an out-of-touch audience with things like "facts" and "reality."

The executive producers of NBC Nightly News were reportedly pleased with Chris' work, and in addition to "promising to never login to a Gibson in Russia ever again," have expressed hope that he will create a longer, multi-part investigative piece for future broadcasts. A relieved Mr. Toppleston admitted, "With Hackers' running length of 107 minutes, minus credits and title, I've got another 19 segments in my back pocket. Peabody Award, here we come."
