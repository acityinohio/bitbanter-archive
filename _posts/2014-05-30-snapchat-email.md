*A note from Evan Spiegel's "standing desk," which is what he calls his female assistant*

Greetings faithful Snapchat fans. Yesterday, I was rudely interrupted from my mid-day Chakra alignment by startling news. I was shocked to read absolutely [horrible things written about me](http://valleywag.gawker.com/fuck-bitches-get-leid-the-sleazy-frat-emails-of-snap-1582604137). But like all great leaders---except my spiritual mentor, Steve Jobs, who never had to answer to anybody, and just to clarify I hugely respect that---it's time to own up to my mistakes. What they are saying is absolutely true.

I neglected to delete my email. And I'm deeply, deeply sorry for my oversight.

*Desk, read that back to me. Good. That sounds contrite enough. Also, didn't I tell you not to wear that blouse? It's really not flattering. No it's fine; let's just make sure it doesn't happen again.*

I'm sure many of you are now asking: "How can I trust Evan McSuckMyDick? And how can I acqui-hire such a cool frat nickname?" Well, concerning the latter question, if you even have to ask, you'll never know. Cool response right? It's this Zen thing I learned from an amazing Time magazine article that I'm forcing my employees to read. Maybe you'll figure it out, just don't try too hard.

But I digress. How can you trust me---the barely post-pubescent, shifty face of the largest vanishing messaging service on the planet---when I didn't securely delete my prior communication? I must look like such a vapid blonde right now. I mean, I am blonde, but to be clear, I meant like a blonde girl.

*Standing desk, that doesn't seem quite right. Can't put my finger on why. Delete that last line, thanks. Yes, yes, get my PBR first. Christ, sometimes I swear I need to retrain you.*

Look, these are valid concerns. But you should know a few things before judging too harshly:

1. This oversight happened ages ago. In college. I wish I could give you an exact date here, but it all kinda blurred together. In any event, it was way before I discovered the Tao and became the disruptive business scion you know and love.
1. Consequently, this was the dark ages of messaging. With SMS and Google chat and ugh, email. Who could remember to delete everything? And how could I force others to delete my messages too? It was just such an unwieldy problem back then.
1. This kind of problem is exactly why I, and I alone, without anyone's help, created Snapchat. I only wish I had made it sooner.

I obviously regret what's happened, but---and I don't mean to sound like a self-promoter here---this would have been the perfect use case for Snapchat. We delete everything you send, except for huge troves of meta-data for our Shadow Social Graph (patent pending). Sure, with some simple data-mining, we can make educated guesses about your snaps using only the timestamp and recipient. But they're just guesses! We can't actually see your dickpic or derogatory comment; we're only 98% sure they're there. Which is just like the NSA, and we're totally cool with that as a society. So trust me...and together, let's make sure something like this never happens again.

...although I admit, once I get some juicy meta-data on that expose-writing Valleywag Biddley-fuck, I'm gonna burn him worse than a 151 body shot on pledge night.

*No, standing desk, don't write that! Jesus. You're impossible.*
