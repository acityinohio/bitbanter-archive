title: BlackBerry Embraces "Unplugging", Especially from Real-Time Stock Quotes

*Company discovers unconnected lifestyle promotes clarity, poverty*

Waterloo, Canada -- In its second quarter results, BlackBerry announced record-shattering losses; but more importantly, the company finally revealed the underlying philosophy that brought them hitherto-unheard-of levels of enlightenment and financial ruin.

In a reveal worthy of a Christopher Nolan movie, CEO Thorsten Heins summed his company's vision succinctly: "Two words. Un. Plug. We decided to think even more differently than the competition." After iPhone was released in 2007, BlackBerry clairvoyantly (and secretly) predicted that the Internet -- and smartphones in particular -- would evolve into a distracting, lucrative time-sink. Originally conceived as a productivity tool, the smartphone has since turned into a world-crushing braincrutch, depriving users of basic social skills, time, and staggering amounts of their hard-earned money.

And thus, 2007's RIM (now BlackBerry) faced an existential crisis. Would it continue to operate in the interest of its shareholders/capitalism and build worthwhile, competitive smartphones? Or would it play the spiritual long-game, delaying its userbase from succumbing to 2013's hyper-connected dystopia by purposefully crippling subsequent products while letting its dominant market position whither and die?

BlackBerry chose the latter, and has achieved company-wide zen while destroying an unfathomable amount of wealth.

An anonymous, self-proclaimed "enlightened" ex-employee gave anecdotal tribute to his company's stark metamorphosis. "The last 6 years have been the most calming, transcendentally impoverished period of my life. After the iPhone, the â€˜Unplug' philosophy permeated every part of RIM. We threw away our phones and were forbidden from using other smartphones (including -- and especially -- our own products). We'd spend most of the time meditating and talking -- actually talking! -- with other coworkers. On the rare event of a product launch, our group would haphazardly put together the most unusable phone we could imagine -- in hopes of snapping customers out of their hypnotic state of smartphone-induced zombiehood. Most tended to jump ship to iPhone or Android, but I like to think some of our products were awful enough to inspire some Unabomber-level luddites."

The former employee paused for a moment, and contentment washed over his face. For the briefest moment, he seemed more Dalai Lama than Electrical Engineering PhD. "I can safely say it was the happiest time of my life." The look quickly vanished, and he added, "Unfortunately I apparently no longer have a job, and I haven't looked at my online brokerage in 5 years. Do you mind if I borrow your iPhone for a moment?"

In aftermarket trading, BlackBerry is down 20%, but up on life.
