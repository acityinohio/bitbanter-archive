title: New Startup Reinvents Marketing Wheels
---

*Pointless product made seemingly irresistible through massive behavioral manipulation*

Not Even Close to Copenhagen---In a literally brain-stunning announcement today, Superpedestrian, Inc. unveiled the "Copenhagen Wheel" to stupefied audiences everywhere, making millions salivate at the prospect of spending $700 to ruin their otherwise perfectly functional bicycles.

The "Copenhagen Wheel," which was named semi-randomly through circular reasoning, is a sophisticated electrical motor and battery array that attaches to fixed-gear bespoke bicycles purchased from San Francisco's Mission District. In addition to increasing the weight of your bicycle by 300%, the Wheel transforms the limitless range of the pinnacle of human-powered transport into 40 km, unless you happen to be the secret, fictional lovechild of a doped-up Lance Armstrong and Wonder Woman. Undue complexity is layered into the Wheel through various wireless signals and required smartphone apps, while the Wheel will paradoxically turn your now-worthless mode of transport into a prime target for thieves, as they, too, have been swindled into believing the Wheel confers some some magical worth to a bicycle by systematically removing everything that made it intrinsically valuable.

Simply put, installing the Copenhagen Wheel is only slightly better than giving your bicycle cancer. But unlike cancer, most people really, really want it.

To deconstruct this inexplicable cognitive dissonance, we enlisted the support of MIT Sloan's chief marketing guru and Superpedestrian advisor, Professor Sid Gupta. Says Professor Gupta: "It's important to remember that Superpedestrian started from an MIT lab. A behavioral marketing lab, actually. The Wheel was the culmination of 100,000 man-hours of marketing research, 1,000 man-hours of design and several hours of engineering work outsourced through Amazon Mechanical Turk. And the results have been phenomenal. Based on our preliminary data, I believe we've finally cracked the Da Vinci Code of marketing, and are now in possession of a fool-proof, sustainable, scalable method for immediately selling anyone, anything, regardless of their position in the purchase funnel. I can safely say we've eclipsed the high bars set by Tamagotchis, Pogs and Crocs. This is truly the next frontier."

Unfortunately, much like the Wheel, the Professor made extraordinary, hyperbolic claims while providing something of negligible/negative value. But perhaps, that's the secret ingredient to Superpedestrian's marketing sauce after all?

"No," corrected Professor Gupta. "Look, to be honest, all it takes is heavily optimized SEO alongside a brightly-colored Youtube video containing attractive people and a xylophone doing power chords."
