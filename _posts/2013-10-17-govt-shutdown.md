title: Horrendous, Unending Stream of Facile Government Shutdown Jokes Finally Shut Down
---

*Congress does us all a great public service, ends cacophony of toddler-grade humor*

Your Twitter Feed, the Internet -- Your representatives in Congress have finally put an end to our national nightmare of increasingly hopeless, despairingly sad shutdown humor. Gone are the days when your feeds would be filled with childlike computer metaphors for our nuanced system of governance, where 80% of your news was filled with lackluster Photoshops of "Blue Screens of Death."

"The last 17 days have been an unmitigated, cognitive disaster," said President Obama in a speech announcing the end of the Internet-destabilizing vomitstream that some commentators called "the anti-singularity of creative thought." 

Obama continued: "In the last two weeks, the American populace has dropped a collective 3 billion IQ points, while the international perception of our country as an exemplar of novel creativity has been forever tarnished. And, quite rightfully, the American people blame the Republicans (a party that barely understands the Internet) for unleashing this tumor of hiveminded joke-tragedy upon our collective cyber-consciousness. I think I speak for everyone when I say: Fuck You Ted Cruz."

Senator Cruz was quick to respond, saying "It's going to take a lot more than a few four letter words to â€˜Shut Down' the Cruzinator! I've got one switch, and it's always on, America."

At press time, Senator Cruz has been banned from Twitter and the Senate floor.
