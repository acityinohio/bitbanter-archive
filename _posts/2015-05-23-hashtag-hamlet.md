*This section of Act 1, Scene V of "Hashtag Hamlet" sponsored by [this Tweet](https://twitter.com/acityinohio/status/601250943078764544)*

*Enter HORATIO, bumping into HAMLET, both absentmindedly staring into phones*

**HORATIO**: What's trending, Hamlet?

**HAMLET**: I'm hashtag killing it Ho'.

**HORATIO**: Squee! Tell me tell me.

**HAMLET**: Hell no, you'll spill on YikYak.

**HORATIO**: I swear. I don't snitch.

**HAMLET**: Fine, but if you Snap this, y'all not getting my Coachella tickets.

**HORATIO**: Well duh. 

**HAMLET**: Alright, so there's a rachet stench in Denmark.

**HORATIO**: I don't need your Dad's creepy Facebook post to tell me that.

*GHOST drifts briefly across stage, looking saddened by this*

**HAMLET**: Jesus Christ Horatio, do you even want to know what's going on? And next time, trigger warning about my fucking Dad. You know how he makes me feel.

**HORATIO**: My bad, Ham, I'm sorry, no disrespect. But watch the language here, no need to go HAM, this is supposed to be family-friendly.

**HAMLET**: You say that as if my family is friendly. And oh, I'm sorry, when did you get all prissy about words? Sticks and stones Horatio.

*HORATIO sighs heavily*

**HORATIO**: No offense, Hammie.

**HAMLET**: Don't call me Hammie. And there is offense Horatio. But not from me. No, from these ratchet assholes that won't leave Denmark alone. Can you just do me a single favor Horatio?

**HORATIO**: Anything, Hamlet.

**HAMLET**: Shut the fuck up and listen, and don't tweet what you've seen tonight. 

*HORATIO stares blankly*

**HAMLET**: Swear it. I've drafted a Non-Disclosure Agreement to this effect and I cannot continue unless we NDA it. As friends.

*75 minutes and three redlined drafts later*

**HAMLET**: Excellent. We'll have no moles or rats here, or face massive litigation.

**HORATIO**: You're a strange bird Hamlet.

**HAMLET**: As I said before, shut the fuck up and listen. There are stranger things than tweetie birds about, and you can tweet that if you'd like. I've dreamt things that you can't even. YOU CAN'T EVEN, HORATIO.

**HORATIO**: ...Hamdawg, I'm beginning to worry you're not on fleek.

**HAMLET**: WORRYING IS NOT ALLOWED PER THE AGREEMENT YOU SIGNED PREVIOUSLY. Do you not remember Clause 5, Section 3? Do I have to get my lawyer?

**HORATIO**: No, Hamlet, you don't, we're friends.

**HAMLET**: Are we Horatio? Did you not mute me on Twitter, and block my updates on Facebook? WHY AREN'T YOU FOLLOWING ME ON INSTAGRAM HORATIO?

**HORATIO**: Okay, you know what Hamlet? It's because of shit like this. You're right, I can't even. I'm done man, I'm just done.

**HAMLET**: OMG YOU'RE JUST LIKE MY UNCLE. I THOUGHT WE WERE COOL, HORATIO.

*...the rest of the play features Hamlet and Horatio passive agressively tweeting about eachother, after which Hamlet does a TEDx Denmark talk about starting a non-profit to prevent online bullying*
