Seattle, Washington---The growing rift between Amazon and book publishers has reached boiling point (plus 239 degrees) today as the retail giant takes drastic new steps to bolster its negotiating power. While this pricing standoff continues, Amazon has made a firm commitment to incinerate its existing stock of externally published books. Amazon Prime users who ordered any of the offending books will continue to receive two-day shipping---of the charred, ashen remnants of their orders, alongside a personalized letter from Jeff Bezos admonishing them to "Look at What They Did." 

Amazon is turning up the heat on an already hot-and-bothered sector of the economy. The book industry has been assaulted from countless forces, not just within. Thanks to cat gifs, Vines and Tumblr porn, most Americans barely maintain serviceable literacy and refuse to indulge in long form content. The remaining few are avid readers, but only insofar as their voracious reading enables them to discover spoilers before they appear on HBO.

Those few passionate consumers, unsurprisingly and somewhat irrationally, are coming to Amazon's side. "The way I view it, publishers are nothing but middlemen, barriers between me and content. Amazon is trying to streamline the process and reduce prices on my behalf," defended dedicated Prime member Sam Creek. "If they have to burn a few books/bridges/people to do it, more power to 'em. Maybe one day there won't be any publishers and Amazon will be the only place to get books! They'll become the ultimate middleman, but with arbitrary, monopoly power." 

"...wait, that doesn't sound quite right." We left Sam dejected and confused, as most ardent Amazon supporters become when it dawns on them that they're actually rooting for a Walmart clone.

Consumers aside, economists are somewhat baffled by the move, as Amazon is clearly destroying economic surplus. Hans Rivers, a media industry-focused economist at the MIT Media Lab, remarked: "I've witnessed my fair share of sub-optimal media blunders, but this puts them all to shame. It's the fiscal equivalent of 47 47 Ronins."

Desperate for some reasonable explanation, we turned to Harvard-based behavioral economist/anthropologist Franz Fjord. "Look, I don't think there's a rationale that will ultimately satisfy anyone. That said, I once studied a group of chimps whose alpha males exhibited a peculiarly similar behavior. When starving, they would gather food, but not eat it. Instead, they would defecate in it, then bludgeon lesser males with the amalgam and eventually cannibalize them."

"Was it economically efficient?" pondered Franz. "No. But did the alphas enjoy it? I'd bet a dozen shit-mangoes on it."

Publishers have taken the beating quietly, matching the new-found silence of millions of fictional voices lost in the embers of textual coal, trapped in the industrial inferno of Amazon's hubris, metaphor, and flaming kerosene. But Jeff Bezos hasn't lost his step.

Bezos made a rare public comment, dispelling any notion that Amazon would back down. "Until our demands are met, there is no choice but the Path of Light. I will set aflame the publishers themselves, and I will find their loved ones, and I will make them weep over their ashes. I will make paper itself a faint memory, and if need be, I  will scorch a path through the unexplored vastness of the rain forest which bears our name. The smoke will blot out the sky, and we will have rewritten the pages of history. Pages which will be found, and incinerated in turn. Spoiler Alert: I am Azor Ahai reborn."

Bezos paused for a moment, then made his signature, spine-chillingly not-quite laugh. "...but anyway, what I really mean to say is: you should really check out our Kindle Fires. They're fantastic devices at a great price point."
