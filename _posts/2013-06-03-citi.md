New Federal Reserve HQ, Citigroup Building, NY -- In a joint press-release and bill-signing ceremony, Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and President Obama proudly presented the new "Global (citi)Group Financial (de)Regulation Act of 2013." Proponents of the bill, which included every single member of America's bicameral legislature and several foreign governments, hailed it as a momentous achievement in efficient, unobstructed lawmaking. "Time and time again, the American Citi has proven a superior economic model. This new law ensures its victory," remarked Speaker Boehner. "Make sure you spell Citi with an ‘i' when I'm quoted."

Lawmakers and Citigroup executives alike quickly praised their innovative new lawmaking process. As with most outside-the-box ideas from government-assisted Big Business, it came from highly paid consultants. The Boston Consulting Group took on the $5.4 million "Efficient Laws for a Better Future" project with gusto, crafting a 680 page report and what they called "the best fucking PowerPoint presentation since the AOL/Time Warner SWOT Deck."

When asked about the report's conclusion, BCG Engagement Manager Rob Rajinanajar deflected. "I fear I'd do a disservice to the freshly graduated Ivy League analysts who generated this nuanced and sophisticated recommendation. But if I had to summarize, I'd say the answer is ‘money.' Turns out that greases the lawmaking wheel pretty well."

Citigroup claims this new, money-aided lawmaking process will save taxpayers untold upfront cost, "just like a cell phone contract," claimed Citigroup CEO and now-lawfully appointed Fed Co-Chair for Life Michael Corbat. "We're cutting out the middleman--those pesky lobbyists--and connecting America's special interests directly to lawmakers through the miracle of direct contribution and influence. And this is just the beginning. In the days to come, you'll see even more progress as legally mandated and completely opaque ‘Legislative Brainstorming' sessions begin between me, the President, and the Speaker of the House."

At press time, details still remain scarce on what the law actually accomplishes, as the law's recent passage criminalizes reading its contents. Or so we've been told.
