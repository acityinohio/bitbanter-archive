*Customers love the snug fit; Comcast, not so much*

Mountain View, CA -- Google released the Chromecast earlier this week, delightfully surprising consumers while filling Comcast with the inescapable dread of an inevitable ass-raping. What's got customers trembling with excitement while Comcast desperately searches for Vaseline? The Chromecast, a $35 dongle, enables streaming video from a wide array of Internet-connected devices; all while streaming anti-monopolistic hate-splooge directly into Comcast's exposed, brown-tinted starfish.

Early reviews are generally positive; customers and Comcast seem surprised by the amount of pleasure and pain derived from the 3 inch-long device, respectively. "Chromecast makes my overpriced cable subscription obsolete! It's what I've always wanted from Comcast, along with three extra letters," noted both a statistically average American consumer and a Comcast SVP in very different tones.

The Chromecast is exceptionally easy to install. Users simply bend over and plug the device into an open HDMI port on their televisions (if the user is Comcast, they also remove their pants). Then, after a brief setup, video can be automagically streamed to their TVs while their Internet device becomes a simple, effective remote. Newer televisions will even detect when a stream is present and switch inputs away from the cablebox, increasing customer satisfaction while savagely asphyxiating Comcast of revenue and tearing the telecommunications giant's now-fragile taint.

The Chromecast includes a micro-USB cable, the device, and in the Comcast-edition, an abrasive, low-thread-count towel for cleanup. Currently, the most watched video through the Chromecast is a livestream of the Chromecast utterly annihilating Comcast's dirty sarlacc pit. The second most watched video is a youtube compilation of cats fitting themselves into cardboard boxes.
