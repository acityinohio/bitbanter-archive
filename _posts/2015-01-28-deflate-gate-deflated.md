Cambridge, MA---After a whirlwind effort of dozens of economists, cognitive scientists, and statisticians, a Harvard-funded group has come to the stunning conclusion that 1% of the cognitive energy put into the recent controversy surrounding the New England Patriots could have ended world-wide poverty, permanently. "We were amazed too," said Professor Jan Turwich, head of the $10 million project. "We thought perhaps curing Ebola was in the cards, or optimistically an HIV vaccine, but ending all abject poverty on Earth? It's just stunning."

The group compiled data from thousands of media outlets and Internet sources, discovering a wealth of deep Deflategate analysis. The scale of the effort spent analyzing the ramifications of a partially inflated football dwarfs all human efforts by an almost unimaginable margin. "It's equivalent to 12 Moon Landings, 25 Manhattan Projects, and 243 Giza-class Pyramids," claimed Jan. "The meticulous study of Tom Brady's ball habits is now the single greatest legacy of the human race."

"...may God help us all," added the Professor, while quietly accepting a separate $5 million grant to study the effects of Rick Perry's glasses on his Presidential bid.
