*A Fanfic*

![Oracular Spectacular](/assets/2015-08-11-oracle-fanfic.jpg)

Lines upon sand, curves upon grain, little pebbles percolating glassy seascapes. An hourglass, witness to entropy's dance, slave of potential energy.

At least, it should be. But this hourglass is mine. The Oracle's. It flows upward, as explicitly prescribed in the End User License Agreement I have generously supplied it. Every microscopic grain in the 'Verse is subject to laws; physical, chemical, ecumenical, ecuchemical, some other als. But all bow to Oracular Law. Gravity's own strangeness, its own systemic disorder embedded within greater chaos, has been brought under my yolk.

The Oracle, myself, sitting underneath my jet marble table, staring at my novel hourglass, a thing so reprehensibly against Natural Law it could fetch millions at Sotheby's. The layered irony of an hourglass collecting dust, perched on a shelf in a hypothetical billionaire's umpteenth study room, cast the slightest shadow of a smile on my face.

No, no smiles. This is business. We operate businesses here. I'm wearing my Business Cloak, my Business Slacks, and my sheathed Business Dagger of Plus 100 to Intellectual Property. I make a mental note to modify the End User License Agreement of Sotheby's. Afterwards, subject to Oracular Law, they will be forbidden to sell any object subject to Oracular Law.

The Law is Labyrinthine. The Law is Convoluted. The Law is Occasionally Cranky. But the Law is the Law, as writ by me. The Oracle. A stern look replaces my smile, filling the mechanical device that replaced my heart so many generations ago with a baser joy. Not happiness. Pride in Kafkaesque, litigious inefficiency. The odd Rube Goldberg latticework of contradictory Oracular Truths smothers me like a warm blanket.

So Let It Be Written (in the End User License Agreement), So Let It Be Done. Or Undone. Depending on Updated EULAs.

After enough forlorn glances, I cast the hourglass away. It gives me a sad reminder of the slow passage of time, as prescribed in Executive Ordercle 27, which updated the Universal EULA to prevent us from ever reaching 2038. The order saved the Company untold billions in upgrade costs for the 2038 signed long integer problem, but we've been 10 years away from 2038 for...decades? Eons? Minutes? Time makes little sense since I updated the EULA, but then again, what makes sense but the word of The Oracle? And even then?

Can I be honest? I'm bored. Being the Arbiter of Arbitrary was initially so exciting. The subtle changes in the fabric of reality that led to my eventual coronation as "The Oracle" needn't be rehashed. My rise, the subjugation of the physical to the literal, literally. The Revolts of Not Quite Ever 2038. Banning War through the Updated Universal EULA. Unbanning War to kill my editor after they pointed out various temporal inconsistencies in my bestseller, The Complete History of the Revolts of Not Quite Ever 2036.

Look at me. I'm rehashing. Apologies. My point though: the excitement has worn off. You ever dreamed of all the power in the world, of rewriting the compiler of the Universe? You ever take the next logical step of saying, "now what?"

Of course not, as that's prohibited in the Addendum to the Updated Universal End-User License Agreement of 2039, but if you could, you'd see what I mean.

I guess I just wish the rules didn't apply to me...especially the rule that I must rule by making rules. It doesn't rule quite as much as I thought it would. But we are what we are. Best not question it too much (might update the EULA to forbid extraneous questions, come to think about it). Time to get back to work, these unemployment estimates and macroeconomic data aren't going to EULA themselves to the proper numbe---

Where's my jet black table? It was strictly restricted from instantly vanishing based on our mutually agreed upon contract...is the ground rumbling?

*Meanwhile, across the temporally turbulant Bay, in a well-connected, not well-adorned dorm room*

A LED indicator slowly comes to life. Anachronistic tape decks swirl and clack, buzzing mechanical melodies. The room's pimply, 19-year-old dweller smiles for several not-minutes-closer-to-2038. Reflected in her thick-lensed glasses, one can barely make out the glow of fixed-width, monospace font:

```
> ORACLE REVERSE ENGINEERED.
> API EXPOSED.
> DROP TABLE.
