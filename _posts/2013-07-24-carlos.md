New York, New York---Anthony Weiner momentarily suspended his campaign to decry startling revelations about the nation's electronic intelligence agency. "Today, I discovered that the National Security Agency has no idea what my penis looks like," Weiner claimed at his press conference, while his wife struggled to maintain her composure behind him.

"I have misused nearly every electronic communications platform available, ranging from faxes to Instagram. I even telegraphed an ASCII representation of my penis to the estate of Samuel Morse. Yet despite my efforts, a recent memo from the NSA claimed that none of them have any idea what my penis looks like, and---even more startling---they couldn't care less." 

"They don't even have any intelligence on the general shape of my bulge. As 10,727 women and 126 men can attest, this is a god damned travesty." Weiner's wife choked back a sob while angrily eyeing her husband. "They didn't even use the few cycles of compute time necessary to cross reference me with my alter-ego, Carlos Danger. Apparently, my majestic girth wasn't a â€˜high profile target.'"

While Weiner will have virtually zero power to enact national intelligence policy if elected New York Mayor, that has hardly tempered his agitation for change. Weiner will strive to make NSA prioritization more transparent, noting that "Big Tony" represents a terrible and awesome power, one worthy of at least a casual inspection. "Besides, we need to live in a more open, transparent society. For example, why am I even wearing pants right now? And are any of you journalists single? Is that camera on?"

The NSA refused to comment, although a junior analyst hinted that the agency has several TFLOPS of computing power dedicated to filtering the petabytes of Anthony Weiner's digital dick noise from the Internet, which they have designated the "Schlongstream."
