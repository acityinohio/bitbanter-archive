title: Google's Adorable KitKat-Android Partnership Completely Overshadows Microsoft's Desperate Nokia Purchase

Mountain View, CA---Google made a surprise announcement today to promote an utterly vapid, yet undeniably adorable, partnership between Nestle and the search-giant. Under terms of the deal, the next version of Android will be codenamed "KitKat," while consumers who purchase specially marked KitKats have a chance of winning a Nexus 7 or Google Play credit. Concurrently, Nestle unveiled a cute, startup-inspired website alongside a snarky YouTube video to promote both KitKat's empty calories and their empty, meaningless partnership with Google. Both parties claim no money changed hands, which all experts agree is the only part of the agreement that makes any goddamn sense.

Speculation has been rampant about the next dessert to take the Android crown, as the "Jelly Bean" moniker has remained a stalwart Android companion for years. "I really thought it would be Key Lime Pie. After dozens of hours of hunting down leaks, it seemed like a slam dunk. This must have been a pretty last-minute change," speculated one man who agreed to be publicly identified, despite the irreparable damage this quote would cause to the shaky claim that he engaged in sexual intercourse once. (This article decided to protect his identity for his own sake)

Other effects of the deal are not yet fully understood. However, after discussing this topic for significant, non-marginal units of time, a general consensus of Internet denizens agree it would make even less fucking sense if Nestle was given design input into Android or vice-versa. A few bored EVE Online players also posted a spreadsheet-derived estimate of perceived benefits for both parties, claiming that Google stands to gain several hundred thousand dollars in Android promotional value. Nestle, on the other hand, could accrue several million dollars of KitKat-based  revenue, thanks mostly to the American education system's failure to properly teach the probability of winning contests.

Meanwhile, in far less important news, Microsoft agreed to purchase Nokia's device business and the game "Snake" for $7 billion.
