*Blogger decries Facebook in polished, A-B tested headline*

After stunning revelations that Facebook conducted a massive psychology experiment with its users---which negatively affected the emotions of millions---22-year-old BuzzFeed technology reporter Blake Stanton was incensed. "OMG guys, we are Facebook's guinea pigs," wrote Stanton, after discarding 13 separate, less-engaging variations of this sentence tested against 1% of BuzzFeed readers.

Stanton's story included 20 animated gifs, including one adorable guinea pig wearing hipster glasses. Several of the images were swapped on-the-fly as Stanton tweaked the article to reach "maximal virality"---an opaque metric determined by terabytes of real-time readership data siphoned through BuzzFeed's "secret sauce" formulas. Once optimized, Stanton's article had a high tendency for sharing, owing to his scientific disbursal of nostalgic Full House gifs and recent Internet slang. "You gonna get rekt, FB," tweeted Stanton to huge, measurable approval.

Unfortunately, Stanton didn't have much time to celebrate his achievement, after his editor announced that he---alongside all human writers---were being fired. According to BuzzFeed's latest blogpost, titled "LOL Humans," they're being replaced by an algorithm that will semi-intelligently combine the highest-rated posts on Imgur, 4chan and reddit into a single stream of sharing-optimized content. 

In a somewhat coordinated response, Facebook announced they're removing the network's human element to avoid future "ethical issues." Starting next week, all human profile status updates and link shares will be auto-generated based on past behavior. Facebook hopes this will lead to a "golden era of machine-to-machine sociability and amazing targeted advertising." Several large brand-focused companies, like Coca-Cola, GM, and General Mills, have already signed massive advertising deals to generate new likes on Facebook, seemingly unconcerned that they're advertising to unfeeling machines occupying the husks of once-vibrant Facebook profiles.

The algorithmic trading engines that principally affect Facebook's stock price reacted positively, pushing Facebook's stock price to an all-time high.
