*Google finally proves that if you don't talk about something, it doesn't exist*

San Francisco, CA---At their annual developer conference, Google introduced its "Google Minus Plus" program, a massive coordinated effort by the search giant to categorically deny Google+'s existence by omission. "Today, we're excited to talk about Android TV, Chromecast, and some incredible updates to the Android platform," said Chrome/Android chief Sundar Pichai, completely neglecting to mention Google+. Still other Google presenters showcased some amazing new tech demos, while refusing to acknowledge the millions of man-hours that went into Google's Facebook clone.

Google made a huge effort to unify the experience between their web and mobile design, using so-called "Material Design" guidelines, demonstrating this new look in every web property they own except for Google+. "You're going to love it," said Matias Duarte, flipping through a hard-copy of the Material Design Guidelines which failed to show a single example of Google+. When asked about Google+'s strange absence, Matias muttered, "...it's no longer Material to Google. But forget about it, check out this sweet z-axis stuff."

The closest Google came to validating the existence of Google+ was during the keynote's Chromecast demonstration, where a presenter errantly said "...you can even stream your own Google Plu--photos...Google photos to your Chromecast" before getting death-stared off the stage by Sundar. 

As to be expected, response to Google's lack of + has been muted. One of Google+'s eleven users sent a complaint letter by post, but they refused to share its contents through Google+, posting "why bother?" on Twitter. Former SVP of Social---and Google+ champion---Vic Gundotra reportedly posted an auto-awesome'd GIF of a single tear falling down his cheek on Google+, but like the proverbial tree falling in a forest, we cannot confirm if it exists.
