title: Detroit Files for Relevancy

*Motor City makes bold attempt to infiltrate the national zeitgeist today*

Detroit, a city that once inexplicably captured America's imagination and industrial ambition, has filed for Chapter 1 Relevancy and catapulted into the national spotlight today. City officials made the announcement by spending the city's last $10 million of liquid assets in a blowout extravaganza that reportedly made Sean Parker (who was in attendance) blush.

"People say Detroit failed because of the 1967 riot, the failure of American automakers and the municipality's general ineptitude and corruption. Well, I say, they're wrong!" said one of the city's former mayors, who had received a special dispensation from Wayne County Jail to appear at the event. "We can make Detroit relevant again!" he screamed, tossing handfuls of flaming hundred dollar bills at the roaring crowd as a controlled explosion destroyed the 36th District Courthouse.

Experts agree that Detroit has never been more prominent than today. But they disagree on what happens post-Relevancy. "No one has ever attempted to make something relevant so forcefully and at such a scale," explained Michigan State Economics Professor Dan Davidson. "What happens afterward? Will we maintain our relevance, or squander this chance and descend into irrelevant chaos? No one knows, but I'll be damned if I'm the only one left in this shithole to find out."

The last remaining city official on payroll was happy to report the event claimed only 8 murders, making it the least deadly public event in Detroit's storied history of violent public events. He then asked if we could spare some change, or perhaps a Greyhound ticket to anywhere else.
