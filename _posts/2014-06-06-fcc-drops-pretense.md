Washington, D.C.---In the latest effort by the Obama administration for "more transparency in government," the FCC has finally shed any semblance of working for the public good. As of today, the FCC has relinquished its charter to regulate the telecommunications industry and has embraced its true purpose as a mouthpiece for American telecommunication trusts.

"Honestly, I feel liberated," said USTL's Chairman/CEO Wheeler, former FCC Chairman, and former-former cellular and cable industry lobbyist. "My previous lobbying positions felt so siloed; I was either pro-cable or pro-cellular. Since then, the world has transformed. An umbrella organization for every vertically integrated data-delivery company is an absolute necessity---USTL can deliver on that promise. And since we're building this 501(c)4 on the smoldering husk of the regulatory body charged to protect consumers from the government-condoned monopolistic abuses of for-profit telecom, we're going to have unprecedented access."

Wheeler chuckled, interrupting his statement abruptly. "You know, in a way, we're going to have a practical monopoly on telecom lobbying. Fancy that!"

The FCC's transformation has been planned since Wheeler's appointment by President Obama, while some reports suggest Wheeler's acceptance of the Chairmanship was contingent on the FCC's dismantlement. Consumers can expect a number of immediate ramifications:

* Public input on new policy will no longer be ignored---instead, it will no longer be accepted.
* The forthcoming 600Mhz Auction will be designed by a workgroup selected by AT&T and Verizon.
* Sprint's acquisition of T-Mobile will be fast-tracked to simplify both companies' eventual purchase by Comcast in six months. 
* Google Fiber, and any municipal, non-profit ISP are now illegal.
* All angry customer service calls to Time Warner will be immediately flagged by the NSA as "potential terrorist activity." The NSA will reportedly require an additional $1bn datacenter to handle the reclassification.
* Through a massive, unavoidable advertising campaign, Frank Luntz will rename "Net Neutrality" to "Internet Climate Change" and everyone will stop caring.

In a related story, there are rumors that the Securities and Exchange Commission has been formally acquired by Goldman Sachs.
