*US finally admits it was never very good at this game*

Iraqi Consulate, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil---The World Cup excitement has finally reached diplomatic circles here in Rio, and the normally sleepy offices of this local Iraqi consulate are abuzz with activity. That unmistakable pre-game sense of anxious, uncertain fear pervades the office; the tension is so palpable that a security lock down has been in effect for the last 48 hours. Despite the lock down, nearly half of the consulate's Iraqi workforce has seemingly abandoned their posts---and reportedly, their uniforms. Leaving work early to see the game live, no doubt. Those remaining in the consulate are either lifelessly glued to their televisions or chaotically running around the grounds, with no semblance of discipline or organization. Which is just so "classic football fan." 

Surprisingly, until now, none of Rio's diplomatic elite imagined this Iraqi scenario possible. 

"Jesus, none of us saw this coming. Why did we ever pull out [of reffing the game]? Hell, why did we even do it in the first place?" a local CIA bureau deputy told us, eyes glassing over from his fifth Caipirinha. We asked how an entire Iraqi consulate could hide their fanatic love of football right under his nose, but his response was strangely cryptic. After a long stare, he asked us to leave him alone, so he could enjoy his last night before "shipping back to the hellhole soon-to-be-formerly-known as Iraq." We assumed he was still in his cups, and no one ever claimed the CIA was straightforward, after all. 

Seeking an official response, we reached out to the American consulate. "The State Department is always monitoring international developments and endeavors to find peaceful, diplomatic solutions," said a representative. We pushed them, asking why US referees are abandoning the forthcoming game between Iraq and Iran; we were curtly told not to waste their time. After further questioning, we were escorted off consulate grounds and told we were added to some sort of ominous-sounding list. We guessed they're pretty anxious about their own game with Ghana coming up, but that's no reason to be rude.

Undeterred, we reached out to FIFA, the organization in charge of organizing the Cup and maintaining the sterling reputation of soccer as an unshakably incorruptible, objective match of skill that makes it the "world's sport." Unfortunately, the FIFA rep arbitrarily added, then removed time from our interview, before faking an injury to prevent further questioning. Not altogether surprising, really, from an organization that accepts personal blood money in exchange for World Cup hosting rights.

...and apparently, we've just been informed that FIFA sent us a red card for that last sentence. A journalism red card? Christ, what bullshit.

Despite the confusion and dismay on the Iraqi side---they weren't even slated to play this year, and still aren't on the official schedule, weirdly enough, though this wouldn't be the first case of "FIFA" and "Middle East corruption"---the Iranians couldn't be more unified and excited about the resurrected grudge match. The Ayatollah himself has claimed he will "take up arms to ensure a holy victory against our old enemies," and while we're not in the habit of correcting the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic, we don't think "arms" belongs in a soccer metaphor. Still, the idea of an ancient Mullah running around a football pitch will undoubtedly bring some much-needed levity to his people.

Either way, we're looking forward to the outcome of what will assuredly be an exciting game, although we hope it doesn't last more than the regulation 90 minutes. Stay tuned for our next World Cup story, an exclusive scoop on the Russian team's attempt to assassinate the Ukrainian coach using a Polonium 210-infused soccer ball.
