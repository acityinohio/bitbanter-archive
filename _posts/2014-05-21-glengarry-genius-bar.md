*Our scene opens at an Apple Store. It's late and raining, the constant patter of water droplets assaulting 5 sides of the store's cube-like, glassy exterior. Moss and Levene are looking perturbed, mumbling to themselves behind the Genius Bar. There's an incongruous poster of Alan Arkin, silently staring at them from behind.*

*Blake emerges from a back office alongside Williamson. Blake is dressed in a black turtleneck, perfect circle silver-rimmed glasses, crumpled jeans, and worn New Balances. He's holding a Teavana to-go cup. The audience can't tell, but he smells rancid.*

*Blake:* You're talking about what. You're talking about... bitching about that iMac you shot, some sonofabitch who fried their mobo, some broad you're trying to Tinder, so forth. Let's talk about something important. They all here?

*Williamson:* All but one.

*Blake:* I'm going anyway. Let's talk about something important. 

*Levene attempts to plug his dead iPhone into a charger behind the bar. Blake doesn't miss a beat.*

*Blake:* Put. That phone. Down. *There's a long pause while Levene stares down Blake.* Power's for fixers only. You think I'm fucking with you? I am not fucking with you. I'm here from downtown Cupertino. I'm here from Apple Corporate. And I'm here on a mission of mercy. Your name's Levene? You call yourself a Genius you son of a bitch?

*Moss:* I don't gotta stand here and listen to this shit.

*Blake:* You certainly don't pal, 'cause the good news is - you're fired. The bad news is - you've got, all of you've got until WWDC to regain your jobs starting with tonight. Starting with tonight's sit. Oh? Have I got your attention now? Good. 'Cause we're adding a little something to the Employee of the Month contest. As you all know first prize is a Nissan Leaf. Anyone wanna see second prize? Second prize is a set of iPad Smart Covers. Third prize is you're fired. Get the picture? You laughing now? You got leads, soldering irons, resistors. Apple paid good money, got brand name tools for your sorry asses. You can't use the leads you're given, you can't close any circuits, you're shit. You ARE shit. Hit the pigs with some Angry Birds pal, and beat it 'cause you are going OUT.

*Levene, with disgust:* The leads are weak, they can't hold a charge.

*Blake:* The leads are weak? Fucking leads are weak. You're weak. I've been in this business 15 years...

*Moss:* What's your AppleID?

*Blake:* Fuck you. That's my AppleID. You know why, mister? You drove a Hyundai to get here. I drove an eighty-thousand dollar Tesla. THAT'S my AppleID. And yours is you're wanting. You can't play in the man's game, you can't fix a teenager's Macbook Air - go home and tell your Roomba your troubles. Because only one thing counts in this life: maintaining the Reality Distortion Field. Getting them to believe that Apple products aren't commoditized Chinese lumps of aluminum by fixing those fuckers on the drop of a hat. You hear me you fucking bozos?

*Blake presses a button on his iPhone, starting a hidden Keynote presentation*

*Blake:* A-B-C. A-Always, B-Be, C-Charging. Always be charging. ALWAYS BE CHARGING. FOR EVERY SINGLE FUCKING REPAIR. CHARGE THEM FOR EVERYTHING.

*Blake takes a long breath, savors it. Next slide appears.*

*Blake:* A-I-D-A. Attention, Interest, Decision, Action. Attention - Do I have you attention? Your Macbook won't start, so I bet I do. Interest - Are you interested in getting it fixed? I know you are, because it's fuck or walk. You fix or you hit the pigs. Decision - Have you made your decision, for Steve Jobs? And Action. A-I-D-A. Get in here - you got the prospects coming in. You think they came in to get out of the rain and fondle some bacteria-ridden iPad Mini? A guy don't walk on the lot with a 4-year-old Mac Pro unless he wants it fixed. They're sitting out there waiting to give you their money. Are you gonna take it? Are you man enough to take it? What's the problem, pal? Yeah, you - Moss.

*Moss:* You. You're such a hero, you're so rich, how come you're coming down here wasting your time with such a bunch of bums?

*Blake:* You see this watch? You see this watch?

*Moss:* Yeah.

*Blake:* That watch is a pre-production iWatch prototype. It costs more than your car. I made $1 in salary and ten million in back-dated stock options last year. How much'd you make? You see pal, that's who I am, and you're nothing. Good Guy Greg? I don't give a shit. Contribute to Open Source? Fuck you! Go home and play with yourself. You wanna work here - fix! You think this is abuse? 

*Blake inexplicably stares at Alan Arkin poster and goes on miniature tirade*

*Blake:* You think this is abuse, you cocksucker? You can't take this, how can you take the abuse you get on a sit? You don't like it, leave. 

*Levene and Moss look at each other; Blake realizes he seems a tad bit off and regains his composure*

*Blake:* I can go out there tonight with the materials you've got and fix a dozen iPhones. Tonight! In two hours! Can you? Can YOU? Go and do likewise. A-I-D-A. Get mad you son of a bitches. Get mad. You want to know what it takes to be Apple? 

*Blake removes two iPod Nanos from his back pocket, dangling weakly from white earbuds*

*Blake:* It takes BRASS IPODS to be a Genius. Go and do likewise gents. Fixer-upper's are out there. You pick 'em up, they're yours. You don't, I got no sympathy for you. You don't, you're gonna be fitting me for Vibrams. And you know what you'll be saying - a bunch of losers sittin' around in a tea house. 'Oh yeah. I used to be a Genius. It's a tough racket.' 

*Blake takes a pair of gold-plated electric leads from his other pocket*

*Blake:* These are the new leads. These are the Glengarry leads. And they're gold, actual gold, like Beats headphones plugs, and you don't get them. Why? Because to give them to you is just throwing them away. They're for fixers. I'd wish you good luck but you wouldn't know what to do with it if you got it. And to answer you question, pal, why am I here? I came here because Apple Corporate asked me to. They asked me for a favor. I said the real favor, follow my advice and fire your fucking ass because a bozo is a bozo.
