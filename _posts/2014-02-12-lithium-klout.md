title: Lithium-dependent Addicts Buy Klout to Feed Their Disease
---

*Experts contend that injecting "Special K" into Lithium will only prolong their suffering*

Tenderloin District, San Francisco, CA -- A cabal of Lithium abusers have announced their intention to augment their own unproductive, addictive behavior with Klout, or as they call it, "Special K." This sudden announcement came as a surprise to both insiders in the social/drug trade and the general public, both of whom have been content to ignore the Klout epidemic since an initial, overhyped scare in 2008. But for some, the specter of Klout has always haunted them.

Take recovering addict (and prostitute/social media specialist) Unicorn Glitz, a local in the Tenderloin (the drug-addled San Francisco neighborhood where the Lithium/Special K deal reportedly went down). Bemoaned Glitz, "I used to spend days \[without sleep\] trying to get that extra hit, whoring myself out for RTs and Deep Ls. I thought those days were behind me, but now? Shit's gone strange again...can you spare a girl a Pin baby?"

Despite cases like Unicorn's, most officials stress that this "Klout of fear" is overblown, much like the 2008 scare. In the CDC's official statement, they state, "There is no need for alarm. The CDC, in partnership with the WHO, has been studying the health effects of Klout usage for years. We remain confident that even in Lithium-enhanced form, Special K poses minimal threat. There is zero chance of Klout usage exhibiting viral adoption patterns, especially now -- despite what delusional Lithium abusers might think."

A consortium of Lithium users was quick to publicly condemn the CDC from their headquarters, a makeshift island of dilapidated shopping carts somewhere in the Tenderloin. Lithium's representative, a disheveled man wearing the tattered remnants of five different burlap sacks, yelled to a nearby passerby: "I DON'T TRUST THE CDC. DO YOU? THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE 70-POINT K. LISTEN TO ME GOD DAMNIT! LISTEN TO ME!!!" Not long after, the representative was arrested for throwing his feces at that same passerby, although we cannot confirm if that was part of his public statement.

Reportedly, the companies responsible for fueling both Lithium and Special K's growth have profited immensely from this streetwise combination, despite its questionable legality. They refused to comment, but did flash us a knowing, devious smile; a grin, it seemed to us, worth at least 80 solid points of Special K.
