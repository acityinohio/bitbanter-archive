Everywhere, America -- The NSA announced a new project of staggering scale, one that finally matches the agency's practically unlimited production budget. "American PRISN" is the NSA's first (and probably last) reality TV show, and already the critics are buzzing. I'm here to give you an exclusive sneak peak of this amazing achievement in television. After releasing this preview, I hope to finally return safely from the Chinese slum I currently call home. Oh God Kelly I miss you.

According to internal documents obtained from NSA studios, this project has been in the works since the very first Survivor. Originally an NBC/GE collaboration, the NSA quickly shifted gears as technology evolved and now counts the AT&amp;T Borgopticon and the Verizon Omnicollective as partners, although its unclear how profit-sharing will work for both the networks and the 300 million actors. 

Kelly, have you been feeding Chewie? Do you remember how much he loves his belly rubbed after walks, right? I remember. Sweet Jesus, according to this, the NSA does too.

The problem, according to the blood-stained pitch deck I'm holding, is that the NSA felt reality TV didn't successfully represent reality. Too much editing, not enough raw, unfiltered data. American PRISN seeks to capture reality by actually capturing every moment of American reality, and perhaps a few enemy combatants if we're lucky. Oh Mother of Christ, I'm an enemy combatant now. 

More than its technical and legal audacity, American PRISN's rich-media presentation puts other non-interactive TV shows to shame. To call it "television" is to call Hobbes' Leviathan a goddamned neutered goldfish. With American PRISN's revolutionary interface, one viewer can watch hundreds of thousands of Americans simultaneously and without detection or consent. This ain't your father's American PRISN; it's one without bars! Dad...Mom...oh God what have I done?

What's amazing about this reality show, unlike others, is that any American, with or without criminal intent, can be a STAR (Strategic Target Assumed Rival). You're probably trembling with anticipation at the thought of being a star. I am too! Although for me it's mostly the fear of rendition. But then at least the chase would be over. I'm so tired, so very very tired.

So when can you watch American PRISN? The good news is: you're watching it already! At least, a 300 millionth of it. The bad news: the rest of the show is only available to a limited audience with unchecked power and influence. But they seem to love it. The NSA says we'll see a wider release as soon as they can (declassify it). Typical studio behavior! For now, all we can do is wait and hope someone leaks it sooner. Please, leak it sooner. Please God let none of this be in vain.

Oh fuck they're coming through the doors. Kelly, if you're reading this I love yo--
