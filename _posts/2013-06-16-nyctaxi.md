*"Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads" -NYC Taxicabs*

In New York, NY---Concrete jungle where dreams are made oh, there's nothing you can't do. Unless you try NYC's new bicycle lanes, in which case, say goodbye to full motor control and solid food. Thanks to an internal lobbying effort by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, taxicabs are now allowed (and encouraged) to utilize these lanes, despite--and because of--the prevalence of health-conscious bicyclists. Now, all cabbies must cause ten fatal bicycle accidents a month to remain licensed.

Confused? Mayor Bloomberg explains. "Look, I was initially against it too. But healthy people actually cost the City more due to their longevity; turns out I was totally off base on that soft drink thing. With these new regulations and blanket immunity for cabbie-based manslaughter, taxis become the City's most efficient way to both transport sedentary citizens and cause healthy fatalities, saving our great city its most precious resources: time and money. Additionally, I believe this will bolster our â€˜Stay Inside, Order a Pizza and Code' campaign."

As expected, response amongst New York bicyclists has been muted, since most can no longer speak. Tech pundits are hailing both cabs and the new law as an innovative new strategy to turn New York into a world-class technology center, somehow.

Federal regulators were initially against the law's passage, since it violates the Constitution, the New York State legal code, and the generally accepted principle that murder is wrong. It has already been challenged in court, but the case was quickly dismissed after Mayor Bloomberg stormed into the courtroom and menacingly reproduced Denzel Washington's "King Kong Ain't Got Shit on Me" monologue from Training Day.

Unfortunately, Uber was not included in the new law's coverage, and uncharacteristically must use regular, non-special lanes. However, Uber is lobbying hard for coverage, and hopes to amend the regulation to include an additional monthly quota of one-dead-prostitute-per-trunk.
