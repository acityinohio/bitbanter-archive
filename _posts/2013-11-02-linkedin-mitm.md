*An excerpt from a recent board meeting*

Not Very Secret Underground Conference Room, LinkedIn HQ, Mountain View---Gentlemen, I have a confession to make: I don't drink municipal water. And why should I? The NSA has access to my water utility's metadata. I won't let the waxing and waning of my bodily fluids put me on a watch list. That's why I drink nothing but Coke Zero by way of Amazon Subscribe-and-Save. Checkmate, nanny state.

...what? Yes, of course you idiot, I know Jeff Bezos will have my data instead of the government. But he's a private citizen goddammit, and he's rich enough to be entitled to my data.

Which reminds me, gentlemen...it's time to change our stance on security. We're going at it all wrong. We need to be one-upping these government spooks and Googly weirdos. In reality, our users' insecurity has always been the core of our business; it's nigh time that insecurity manifests itself physically. We must become the Man-In-The-Middle.

"But Reid, won't our customers abandon us? Maybe we shouldn't assume they'll let this slide," you say. Are you trying to debate me on this? Here? Let me remind you that THERE IS NO DEBATING IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM. This is where I delegate my bold vision of the future, where you have the privilege of enforcing the edicts of a Platonic Philosopher-King (to clarify: that's me).

Let's face the facts gentlemen: good security is hard. Does anybody here understand how 2-factor authentication works? Of course not. Do you know how many RFCs we'd have to read to approximate "best practices?" Too many for our barely literate sales-dominated organization to comprehend, that's for sure.

So instead, like our users, let's wear our insecurity as a badge of honor. Let's add spuriously beneficial services as trojan horses and gradually dismantle their expectations of privacy. We could use an innocuous product moniker, like "Intro," "Smiley," or "Instagram." Let's demonstrate a cornucopia of methods to circumvent users' basic security under the guise of product demos and technical walkthroughs. Let's retire the white gloves and usher in the black hats.

And if users resist? Simple. We threaten to activate the DOOMSDAY DEVICE, which will automatically torrent a public list of plaintext emails and barely salted passwords.

...WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S ALREADY BEEN ACTIVATED?
