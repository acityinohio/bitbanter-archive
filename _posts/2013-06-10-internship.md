*It's almost as if corporate propaganda movies are relics of a shittier era*

Mountain View, CA---In lieu of posting an interactive online report, Google held a press conference to discuss the results of its latest advertising experiment. "Simply put, this A/B test was more of a D/F test," explained Google CEO Larry Page.

That experiment? "The Internship," a Hollywood-produced movie made for the express purpose of testing Google's newly-held hypothesis that "content is king," "movie-commercials are queen," and "Hollywood is a knight or some other kind of easily sacrificed piece." Google's normal, lucrative business revolves around them acting as the world's most efficient middleman; connecting searchers with things that want to be found. This simple formula has successfully disrupted newspapers, magazines, photography, phone books, financial advisors, libraries, schools, non-emergency medicine, gas station map kiosks, music, and rare, collectible hardcore pornography. But Hollywood taunted Google as an impossible nut to crack. (not to be confused with Nutz to Crack Volume 3)

Google SVP of Social and newfound Hollywood Producer Vic Gundotra weighed in at the press conference. "Despite the plummeting cost of content creation, the immediacy and breadth of videos on a broadband connection, the comically tragic prices of tickets, and Gigli, Hollywood has survived. It's thrived, actually, like some giant, metastatic intellectual property leech-monster from an inextricably successful GoPro-shot JJ Abrams film."

Hollywood's continued success caused a come-to-Jesus moment within the search giant. (Unlike Cum in Jesus Moments Part 4, Google's organizational self-reflection was not videotaped or searchable) Google resolved to employ its typical strategy against entrenched incumbents: "If we can't beat them, join them. Then beat them from the inside." This Googly promulgation was the genesis for both The Internship and Beat Them Off: From the Inside.

And the result, SVP Gundotra said, was "educational. In the same way that remedial maths are educational to 22 year-old high schoolers who are basically phoning it in at this point." The movie was a moderate success at the box office, but due to arcane Hollywood accounting rules (known as "wholesale stealing" in the biz) the $10 million movie remains unprofitable at $63 million at the box office. Despite the movie's porous value chain, Google remained hopeful that they would collect useful data from movie watchers.

But such data was impossible to collect. A visibly surprised Larry Page explained: "Turns out that---completely unlike any Internet-connected video viewing experience---theaters don't collect anything in real time. You have to---get this!---survey people AFTER the movie and ask them for their biased, memory-tarnished feelings, instead of observing their behavior as they're engaged in the activity you want to measure. The theater is like one giant black box, where money and people go in and and people come out. In that way it's not entirely dissimilar to Her Giant Black Box 3."

Google concluded the press conference on a defeated note. They have no future movies planned. But Larry Page added one silver lining: "Failed experiments are still worthwhile. In the future, Google won't pour money into marginal businesses that provide zero value to end users while holding back creative expression and innovation. Unless it's apps. Or social."

Separately, at the time of posting, the EFF announced they were actively pursuing legal action against Google for violating their "Do No Evil" compact through the resurrection of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson's acting careers.
