*Democracy has finally met its Tinderella*

Washington, D.C.---The Federal Election Commission, alongside representatives from state election authorities, announced an unprecedented partnership with Tinder to administer America's 2014 mid-term elections. The Commission hopes it will simplify the voting process for millions of Americans who are already intimately familiar with Tinder's mechanics, thanks to their insatiable search for random sex. Projections indicate that turnout would also improve; partly thanks to the improved process, but mostly because a confused segment of the electorate will believe their vote entitles them to random sex.

A representative from Tinder gave us a walk-through of the process. First, consumers would download the TinderUS app for iPhone or Android (sorry, Blackberry/Windows Phone users---in the eyes of the US government, your questionable platform choices make you incapable of voting). On election day, citizens must travel to a location within 500 feet of their registered polling place---TinderUS uses coarse geolocation to discourage lazy voting. Citizens connect to Facebook to confirm their identity with the government. Then, like regular Tinder, citizens will see a series of cards representing propositions and candidates. All cards will prominently display a picture. In the case of propositions, it will be a randomly selected image derived from a Google search of the proposition text. Description text will be limited to 140 characters. Finally, after swiping is concluded, citizens will have an option of sharing their votes through Twitter and Facebook.

Despite the disenfranchisement of huge swathes of the electorate, experts are largely praising this change; especially non-partisan think tanks funded by those who will directly benefit from poor, uneducated people not voting. In rare agreement, both the Cato Institute and the Brookings Institution called TinderUS a "a bold step forward." One expert summarized it this way: "There's a lot of noise out there during the election cycle. TinderUS condenses all that noise into easy-to-digest, easy-to-swipe noisebites. It's going to reduce a great deal of cognitive overhead for voters...the ones that have smartphones anyway." 

But there are still detractors. The EFF and Amnesty International have strongly condemned the move, as TinderUS's source code will remain closed, while audits will be restricted to the FEC and, inexplicably, the Independent High Electoral Commission of Iraq.

Citizens should also take note: there will be some locality-based inconsistencies in the process, as can be expected in any federated electoral process. In any Republican-controlled districts and Florida, swipe directions will be arbitrarily reversed without notice.
