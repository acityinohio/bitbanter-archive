title: A Plucky Mobile Entrepreneur Pitches His Great Grandfather on His Instagram Clone
---

First off, thanks for agreeing to meet. I know how busy things are, and I can't tell you how much I appreciate you squeezing me in before the Matlock marathon on CBS. By the way, in case this runs over, I'd be happy to buy you a full season of Matlock on iTunes. 

iTunes? Oh, it's just an electronic storefront for content. You know, a place to download music and movies directly onto your phone. No, of course you can't see a television show on a rotary phone! Stop being so silly popop.

Anyway, let me start by saying you're the kind of man who intuitively "groks" opportunity. The kind of man who fought in the Second Great War because he possesses an innate understanding of risk and reward. The kind of man who--

What? No, I don't want a candy bar. Thanks, but I've been reading the 4 Hour Body and I'm trying to stay away from-- yes, I agree that 100 Grand is the best chocolate bar around. I just don't want the sugar right no-- okay, FINE. Fine, but I'm saving it for later, okay? Good.

Like I was saying...you're a man who likes taking risks. And, as we both know from your choice of television and candy bars, you're a man of high taste and discerning judgment. That's why I'm talking to you---before anyone else---about my revolutionary new mobile photo-sharing app. Oh, I know that look popop. Another mobile photo-sharing app? How will I blaze a new trail in this saturated market? Yes, yes, I know that look well.

Here's the rub. Everyone talks about "Android first" or "Apple first" on mobile. They're missing the huge gorilla in the room. You know the one I'm talking about, right popop?

...sure. I guess you could make a "King Kong at the talkies" metaphor. But I was thinking more along the lines of Windows Phone. You see, there are a surprising number of Windows Phone users out there, and that market is totally going to subsume Blackberry thanks to Microsoft's enterprise clout; even Apple should be worried.

No, I mean the companies. Yes, I know you can still get Blackberries at the farmers' market.

Look, Windows Phone is a massive opportunity. Even Microsoft is handing out no-strings-attached incentives. I'm pretty sure they'll give me at least a hundred grand.

Sorry, poor choice of words popop. I didn't mean the candy bar. I still want the one you gave me.

But that hundred thousand dollars won't be enough. I need to hire an engineer, brush up my design skills and really start hustling. I've already drawn up some papers, and I'm hoping that you'd be willing to invest as part of a small friends-and-family round.

Yes, popop, I want money, and it's not my birthday. I appreciate that you'd be willing to give me an early present this year but I was looking for a strategic investment, where both of us would stand to benefit...

What do you mean, you can't remember why I'm here? Alright, you know what? Forget what I said. It's my birthday. Yes, I will take the traditional two hundred dollar gift. Thanks popop.
