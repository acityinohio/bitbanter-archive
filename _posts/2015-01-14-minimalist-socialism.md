Given that it's the New Year, I thought I'd start with a more contemplative post instead of the usual satire. Be warned: What follows is nearly 4500 words of intense speculation.

---

If you're a fan of cryptocurrency, you're probably not a fan of [redistributive economics.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistribution_of_income_and_wealth) The contrapositive is likely also true. The intersection of the Venn diagram meets at a tangent, and at the time of this writing, I'm guessing I'm it.

I'm not so bold to believe that this post will change your opinion. Truthfully, I'm not even sure if I believe everything below---and as I discuss below, I know it's impossible to implement it today---but it was an interesting exercise and I would welcome healthy criticism. At the very least, I hope it catalyzes you to think of economic systems as yet undreamed. Voluntary, stateless, decentralized, programmable monetary systems preclude an undetermined inflection point---not just technologically, but philosophically and economically. Where and how it inflects is up to us.

## Why "Fix" Anything?

Let's put aside, for a moment, the design of a society powered by a redistributive cryptocurrency and consider for a moment the big-picture flaws of our system today:

- Laws, finance, and taxes are complex, and are trending toward more complexity...leading to a more fragile society, and more wasted talent becoming lawyers, bankers, accountants, adding ever more inefficient and fragile abstractions onto their respective industries. (See anything by [Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb) for more)
- The more complex these regulations become, the more they benefit people who can afford to exploit its loopholes. Simply put, it's cheaper to be rich. For example, you can hire an accountant/tax lawyer to lower your effective tax rate, or at the highest levels, hire lobbyists to change tax law for you. We live in a society where "spirit" and "letter" of the law have diverged, the gulf between them continuously carved out by entrenched interests.
- Our tendency toward consolidation leads to effective monopolies (either economic or political), which leads to abuses of power. Consider telecommunications (Verizon/Comcast), surveillance (CIA/NSA), or the de facto two-party system (Democrats/Republicans).
- While [Piketty's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century#Allegation_of_data_errors) math is perhaps suspect, I don't think it's hard to argue with the trend of technology/automation disproportionately benefiting the owners of capital. That is not to say that technological progress is normatively bad; I want a self-driving car as much as anyone. But the trend of broader automation through sophisticated AI will likely disproportionately benefit the owners of the technology behind it, especially as those innovations are protected by increasingly draconian Intellectual Property law.
- As an aside, IP law is fundamentally broken; when you can patent math (which is basically the same thing as patenting a kind of Truth) you know something is wrong. Truth, in all its forms, should be free, as should artistic expression...and re-expression.
- Economic growth is considered the most important metric, while societal cohesion takes a back seat. Simply put, we prioritize GDP and full employment over reducing [Gini coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) and freeing humanity from drudgery that could be accomplished by machines. Conspicuous consumption exacerbates this problem, and encourages debt-fueled purchases to "keep up with the Jones'." Debt, which, in turn, causes economic busts, moral hazards, and the "privatized profits, socialized losses" best epitomized by the 2008 financial crisis and response. Not to mention the nefarious effects excessive consumption has on the environment at large. (see: American exurbs, SUVs, McMansions)
- We are almost rich enough to end poverty and wage-slavery in the First World, but we don't care, or (in my mind, mistakenly) believe our corrupted version of not-actually-Laissez-Faire capitalism is worth protecting over human decency and positive freedom.
- We engage in innumerable social injustices by curtailing the rights of individuals in service to vague national security threats (unlawful detainment of citizens) or backwards-thinking politicians pandering to their backwards-thinking districts. (why is gay marriage *still* illegal in so many states?)

Meanwhile, we have gotten a number of things right. Free, competitive markets, alongside entrepreneurial risk-takers, where they *actually* exist, have done wonders for increasing the wealth and well-being of society, as has technological advancement (even when considering the risk of technological capital outlined above). Consumer choice and price discovery works as intended when choice is preserved and prices are not manipulated (by marketing, psychological tricks, or poorly applied taxes/subsidies). Open source projects like Wikipedia and Linux have significantly broadened the world's access to information and technology. Certain human rights have been protected and enhanced, despite the looming specter of an Orwellian, despotically "anti-terror" West.

So society is broken, but to appropriate Churchill, it's the least broken it's ever been. But we can do better, can't we?

## %s/law/math/g

One of the greatest insights of recent cryptocurrency experiments is the revelation that we can, in many cases, **replace law with math, without relying on centralized authority**. An entire class of legal guarantees are suddenly isomorphic to cryptographic ones. Even if the following speculative vision of the future won't come to pass, this insight will have ramifications that will revolutionize society for decades to come. Long and the short of it: if you were thinking about law school, I'd strongly encourage you to reconsider.

"Math as laws" leads to all sorts of possibilities, and affords us an opportunity to cut the Gordian knot of Western society's systemic failures. But how? What will help me generate my preferences for the world? Observation of society's aforementioned flaws, and the application of a rather simple mental exercise. Ever heard of John Rawls' [Veil of Ignorance?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance) It's a fantastic thought experiment, and one worth considering individually. Imagine that you're an architect for the workings/features of a society, but while designing this world, you have no idea what position (with regard to race, intelligence, wealth, social standing, etc.) you'll take within that society. It's a simple idea, and can lead to rather interesting conclusions; for Rawls' own take, you may want to check out his seminal work [A Theory of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice).

My conclusions don't differ much from Rawls', although I employ a dash of techno-libertarianism and prefer Talebian, antifragile solutions to problems (as you've probably guessed by now, I love his work). What does **antifragile** mean? In this context: simple, minimalist foundations of a system that benefits from volatility. Let's get prescriptive. Without knowing my standing beforehand, what kind of world would I want to live in?

## Foundational Principles

To help describe the foundational principles I've constructed in this new society I'm building in my mind's eye, I'm borrowing a rhetorical feature from Isaac Asimov, who gave a rather famous set of [fictionalized principles in hierarchy and precedence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics). In all formulations, there's a deep abiding belief that **simplicity trumps complexity.** Complex rules breed loopholes. Loopholes benefit the powerful disproportionately, and give them license to create more loopholes.

### Zeroth Principle: Information is fundamentally free.

Society progresses when information can be incorporated freely into goods, services, political systems, and the like. Thus, intellectual property would be globally illegal. Yes, that's right. Straight illegal. Copyrights, patents, the whole nine yards. This is mostly to ensure that the best practices/technology of a particular government/corporation could be copied by others (like a governmental genetic algorithm, or a massively fork-able open-source government, a la this [Clay Shirky speech](http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government))---but also because the old refrain about "creators needing financial incentive to create" would break down when they are supported by basic income. 

Today, without financial gain, people already create incredible art/software on GitHub, Youtube, DeviantArt, and hundreds of other places. The financial incentive argument is typically an illusion, and really exists to support the rare owners of especially valuable content; to wit, [Walt Disney lobbied hard for the Mickey Mouse Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act). Social/reputational incentive can still be provided by "proof of initial authorship" added to a cryptographic blockchain (to avoid the ["You Made This, I Made This"](http://imgur.com/snLplqq) problem).

Imagine if all openly shared art could be used permissively, and remixed into other work. Imagine patent trolls becoming obsolete, and IP lawyers not making millions off of frivolous lawsuits trying to decide if Samsung or Apple came up with rounded corners, or if Oracle can patent API calls. Imagine the implosion of Hollywood and cable television, and a freer and more diverse media, creating content out of passion instead of the lowest common denominator (man I can't wait for that one).

Copying and remixing are not just good for market-based economies, they're also natural. Life operates this way (genetic information doesn't respect patents or copyrights) and it's perhaps the most successfully antifragile phenomenon in existence (3 billion years of survival and counting). The success of various open source models (Wikipedia, Linux, and Cryptocurrency, of course) demonstrate that information sharing/remixing is a non-zero-sum-game, even in a world seemingly rigged against them. Private information/trade secrets between parties can always be cryptographically signed so that it *can't* be shared, but otherwise, information should be free.

### First Principle: Everyone deserves basic human rights, including a basic income. No matter who/where they are.

Universal basic income solves so many problems---as mentioned above, many of the red herring arguments for the validity of intellectual property become untenable (e.g., "how will starving artists get paid?"), poverty can be immediately eradicated (at least in the First World), needlessly complex social programs can be eliminated, the rising "specter" of technological automation would be rightfully embraced, and it affords people the opportunity to contribute to society in ways that may not be immediately valued by a purely market-based economy...in a world where information is free, their contributions could immediately be copied by the rest of society (whether it's art, source code, science, or anything else). Even if 95% of society freeloaded off basic income and contributed nothing back, it'd be a worthy price to see the unleashed creativity of the remaining 5%, free to pursue their passions without maintaining a soulless day-job. This would be society's conscious decision to value full actualization over full employment. The rationale for other basic human rights can be summed up succinctly as "The Golden Rule"---or less succinctly as the [Universal Declaration on Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights)---so I won't bother rehashing those arguments here.

### Second Principle: Replace law with cryptography, except where doing so may violate the First Principle.

Property, securities, claims to assets, birth certificates, among many other legal instruments can be replaced with constructs in a cryptographic blockchain, and they should be. Math is infinitesimally more precise than legalese, and infinitely more succinct. The deference to the First Principle is a recognition that acts that violate others' basic human rights (like murder) probably can't be encoded in a blockchain.

### Third Principle: Everyone has the right to property, to engage in voluntary trade for goods and services, and to compete in the free market, whether as an individual or company, except where doing so may violate the First and Second principles.

This still preserves the option for certain rights to be provided by a governmental entity (or virtual governmental entity, if provided by a voluntary cryptocurrency).


### A Recipe for a Better World

All political systems are screwed up, and while I don't know any that are better than democracy, I do know what we need to figure that out: experiments, and the opportunity to do them on a massive scale, while preserving the rights listed above. The only level of government would be the city-state, of which there would be thousands. The styles of governance could vary wildly, but would reach common ground on basic rights guaranteed through a combination of a mutually reinforced treaty. This is straight from Nassim Taleb's playbook. I won't go into too much here; I am merely suggesting a system that is most aligned with the principles above and the proposed cryptocurrency. 

City-state laws and systems of governance may (and should!) vary, as could their systems of local taxation, but as part of their mutually reinforced treaty, they would all leverage a standard cryptocurrency, which we'll call Credits for brevity/futurism. Almost all "global" laws would be codified...or should we say coded...into the Credit protocol's blockchain rules. Most of them would focus on the redistributive and taxation elements of credits, along with a few special rules for entities like corporations/property.

Those laws would be as simple as possible. No income taxes, no arcane corporate tax code. Instead, we'd implement a tax that perfectly aligns the behavior we want (saving, investing, conservation) with the behavior we don't want (conspicuous consumption, high appearance of wealth disparity). A naturally progressive [consumption tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumption_tax) is just the ticket, and oddly enough, one of the few things most economists and I tend to agree on. Both the consumption tax and the redistribution could be implemented automatically through the Credit blockchain, and would not require a central administrative body.

## An Overview of the Credit Protocol

Finally, with the philosophy behind our system complete, let's talk about the Credit cryptocurrency/blockchain. How could it function without central administration?

First, let's dispense with the easy part. In many ways, it would be identical to Bitcoin; it would have independent, Proof-of-Work-based miners and an asymptotic, deflationary monetary supply. This property is necessary to both bootstrap the currency and provide the correct incentive structure for a blockchain to properly function. Where it diverges is the redistributive elements and the rules for the universal consumption tax.

### Collecting the Tax

Collecting a consumption tax in a cryptocurrency is also simple; it's simply a matter of checking whether the appropriate tax was included in any given transaction. That would be accounted for as the difference between the amount sent to the "external" address and the user's "change" address, just as it is done today for Bitcoin miner fees. The difference is that the first x% would go toward the tax---and it would be based on the amount sent to "external" addresses---while the rest would then be collected by the miners as fees. If x% isn't reached, then the transaction would be rejected by any given miner.

What would that x% be? That largely depends on the community wants; I'd advocate 12.5%, mostly because that's easy to compute by bit-shifting by 3, and in a wealthy enough world that doesn't seem too onerous. We'll do some back-of-the-envelope math later to see if this seems about right, but given the dynamic behavioral possibilities of a new tax regime like this, I think experiments would be necessary to prove its fitness; in my experience, the more sophisticated your back-of-the-envelope, the more likely you're tragically wrong.

But there's another wrinkle here that hasn't been discussed, and it hints at the troubled heart of any decentralized basic income regime. How can you tell that the "change" address is owned by the same person---or entity---as the initial address? And the (harder) question which immediately follows: how do you disburse income to each individual and limit fraud?

### Hierarchical Deterministic Addresses to the Rescue

To answer the first question, we can use a concept introduced by Bitcoin's BIP0032, the idea of Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets---a thorough technical explanation of which can be [found on github here.](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)

One of the nice properties of an HD address is that nested public keys can be generated from parent public keys, which means if every address is generated from a parent public key we can tell if the owner of a public address is transferring to another public address that they own...just from deriving the public key. Thus, we could do a computable check for every transaction: if the address is derived from the same public key, it wouldn't be subject to tax; otherwise, it would.

In the hypothetical Credit blockchain, HD addresses are therefore first-class citizens. All addresses used in transactions would be derived from a parent public key---we could set the rules of our blockchain to deny transactions that aren't formed from a derived public key. The corresponding parent private key would be held by individuals. There can be multiple layers of parent-child relationships between keys, as per BIP0032, and with a rule for separate HD address types, a "master public key" of a corporation (or property, or charity, or any other asset) could be owned by multiple individuals, and would be subject to the same consumption tax for purchases (while transfers within the organization would be taxless). A non-Turing complete scripting language can be used---like Bitcoin---to add new layers of automation and continue the trend of replacing law with cryptography.

There are some security concerns here (hence why BIP0032 includes the concept of "hardened" keys, which actually couldn't be used in this context). Mostly, one would have to be very careful with the placement of a child's private key in a non-hardened context...or failing that, we'd need to develop a different HD scheme that allows this flexibility while remaining resilient to the compromise of a child's private key.

But it's definitely technologically possible. The tricky part is telling which master public keys are human beings, and how to disburse the taxes to every human being who's part of the system.

### A Decentralized, Biometric Key-Value Identichain

Yes, it's a mouthful. Let's consider our goals for redistribution: 

- Everyone gets paid once per appropriate period, from collected taxes.
- We wait until some age (16? 18?) for the person to be paid, to avoid gaming the system by having children (and to encourage conservation/contraception/population control).
- Faking individuals/stealing identity should be extremely difficult.
- Death of individuals in the system should be dealt with elegantly.

These are difficult requirements, and honestly, there are probably a number of ways to do this that are better than my suggested approach. But I'd like to suggest this anyway, and hope it encourages others to think of improved systems.

To tackle this problem, we should first ask: what does everyone have that's unique to them? Two answers jump out at me: biological parents, and biometric identifiers. We can use both of these as unique identifiers in a "merge-mined" identity blockchain that uses the same Credit currency (which we'll call the identichain), but with significantly higher fees---because it would be used for initiating new users (aka, babies) into the system and changing master public keys associated with a particular biometric identifier. 

Here's how it would work. Let's say you're a new parent. Congratulations! After birth, your baby's unique biometric identifier could be hashed (using whatever preferred algorithm), and you, your partner, and a few witnesses (like a doctor, third parties for insurance, etc.) would then broadcast this hashed biometric identifier to the identichain, using their own identities on the chain to validate it (aka their associated public keys). Other meta-data could be included, like someone's name, location of birth, etc.

16 years pass. Your child wants to start receiving basic income. They would broadcast a new "transaction" onto the identichain that associates their hashed biometric identity with a new master public key for their HD addresses---it would include a 2-of-x, or perhaps 3-of-x, multi-signature from you, your partner, and the trusted witnesses/godparents that originally witnessed your child's birth (to verify that your child is who they say they are). We're using the closest social connections a person might have to mitigate the risk of someone wrongfully claiming income.

Age can be determined by block height on the identichain. Assuming it's 10 minutes, like Bitcoin's, people could become eligible for income (and therefore inclusion of a master public key on the identichain) after their hashed biometric identifier is roughly 841,000 blocks old; any transaction attempted on the identichain to establish a master public key associated with a younger hashed biometric identifier would be rejected.

A master key associated with this hashed biometric identifier would be a user's general identity, proof of age, and the parent public key to their associated Credit wealth. The first "child" level of this public key would be used as the parent key for their disbursements (so all of their disbursements would actually be to grandchildren of this public master key). They could change this at any time after that first setup by broadcasting a new transaction on the identichain, signed by their prior master key.

Death could be handled by using some kind of "renewal" policy on the identichain. Users would have to broadcast a new master key to the identichain every 4 years (their basic income payments would then be redirected). If they don't, perhaps within a grace period of another 4 years, credits under their master public key (not just the basic income sent to them) could be seized and redistributed to everyone for the next round of basic income. Deaths that are known can also be programmed into the identichain for more efficiency and to allow redistribution of assets to family members (estate tax = consumption tax, in this case) using a similar x-of-y multisig system as births; programmable wills can and should exist!

How do we keep people from cheating this system, generating dozens of fake people, then waiting years for the payments? A few behavioral reasons: humans are impatient, there's the social pressure from requiring x-of-y multisig for noting births, making these births public record, the hope that the identichain would be used as a trans-governmental identity record, and a voluntary check by merchants to check the veracity of the payer (aka, merchants making sure the biometric hash is associated with master public key paying them).

But that's not definitive enough, so there would be one additional rule for funds disbursed via basic income. They couldn't be transferred to any of the members of the multisig group---or corporations they own---that authorized the creation of the new identity unless they've been transferred to a certain number of externally generated public keys. This number would have to be played with---if it's only 6 external addresses, it's still something like 44% of the original funds (assuming a 12.5% consumption tax), which might be enough of an incentive. At a requirement of 30 external addresses, it's something like 1%...including mining fees, this may not be profitable, so I'm guessing the proper number might be 20 to 30.

And that's it. Distributed biometric hashing, another linked blockchain, and slight restrictions on the basic income, and we have the outlines of our system. 

## The (Known) Problems with This Approach

So, firstly, deterministic biometric identifiers don't exist yet---you can only detect "likely" probabilities that someone's iris is their own, for example. This makes hashing somewhat useless. But that requirement could be dropped, and replaced with something like a self-powered hardware Trezor implant (if we wanted to get super futuristic/cyberpunk). In either case, the technology doesn't exist yet. 

The restrictions on basic income seem somewhat forced, but they might be necessary to prevent gaming in a distributed system. I'm sure there are better solutions out there, and would definitely prefer them.

Anonymity would be an afterthought in this system, and it would be taxed heavily (although it wouldn't necessarily be impossible). That said, in answering the question of "Who Will Watch the Watchers?" I prefer to answer "everyone" rather than a "the corporations/governmental agencies powerful enough to have privileged access to that information." I'd rather have a publicly accessible identity ledger that everyone could audit rather than a select few, and rather all of us have oversight. Making known your identity in a public manner seems a small price to pay for basic income, but if you wanted to do something "off-the-grid" it would still be possible.

The incentives---and indeed, the entire process to build this system---don't seem strong enough to bootstrap everything. Moreover, the foundational "genesis-block" of the identichain is an open problem---I don't know how to establish initial trust in the chain (aka the first parents/godparents in the system). 

## As Promised, Some Back-of-the-Envelope Math

There are likely many other unsolved problems here, and I definitely look forward to engaging some of you on the critiques (as I'd like to solve them). But for now, let's have a little fun and assume that we can fix the technical issues. How much, per person, per two-week period, could be earned assuming American levels of productivity and population?

This is actually really hard to guess, and the data we'd use might not be entirely accurate. Still, let's see what fun, fuzzy math we can muster. The US GDP is estimated at $16.8 trillion last year. The Fed estimates the velocity of M2 money supply hovers around 1.5. Let's just assume that would be a good estimate of how much GDP would move around domestically (it's not, but forget that for a moment). If we multiply $17 trillion by 1.5, and our tax rate of 12.5%, then divide by the adult US population of 220 million, we get roughly $14,500 a year, or $550 per person per two weeks. Not bad.

Like I said, it was quite back-of-the-envelope. In my desired system, the destruction of intellectual property would likely lead to some pretty significant short-term paper loss. The loss of millions of (arguably unnecessary) clerical jobs would also affect the short-term GDP. And it would be pretty anti-debt on principle, which would lead to some significant unwinding issues in a world that runs on it. On the other hand, income would no longer be taxed, and neither would savings or investment. So the net result is hard to quantify.

In any event, with AI becoming more and more sophisticated, and the possibility of ever-cheaper renewable power, there's a chance for a massive step-change in productivity growth. $550 per person per two week period could be on the low side once we reach this AI-fueled transition. I don't think it's hard to imagine that this could be quadrupled...even with less fuzzy math. Eventually it could be extended to the rest of the world, and in a more productive age, perhaps it could give everyone a living wage. And unlike the current American government, that's politically impotent/incapable of balancing a budget, this would be programmatically balanced.

## ...I Still Love Bitcoin Though

As I said before, this is some intense speculation and perhaps too much wishful thinking. That said, I think something like this is within reach. Minimalist, stateless basic income is certainly possible, now more than ever thanks to cryptocurrency. 

That said, I'm still a big supporter of Bitcoin, and love seeing the breakneck innovation in the cryptocurrency space. Even Bitcoin is on some level redistributive while promoting savings/discouraging consumption, but in a less direct way, and one that doesn't redistribute equally. Those who hold the currency benefit unequally based on magnitude, because of the speculative and deflationary nature of the currency. (Although recent price history suggests otherwise, that's certainly the long-term view)

I'd love for Bitcoin to be successful, especially if some of these ideas might be experimented upon in [sidechains](http://blockstream.com/), and am excited to see what happens regardless. Bitcoin and its ilk are reminders that we're living in the future; billions of us now walk around with 80s-era supercomputers in our pockets. The future is what we program of it, and perhaps that may one day include a Star Trekonomy. 

I'll continue to explore these ideas, and always welcome feedback/criticism. Tweet [@ me via ACityInOhio](http://twitter.com/acityinohio) or [discuss on HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/). Otherwise, I hope you enjoyed this lengthy diversion from my normal satire, and I'll get back to the funny stuff shortly.
