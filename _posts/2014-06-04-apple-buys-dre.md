San Francisco, CA---Earlier this week, Apple took the tech bubble to new, unfathomable heights, paying $3bn to acquire 57 seconds of Dr. Dre's time during the keynote presentation at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference. Dre, who didn't even appear in person, or perform any music, was the receiver in a call to demonstrate an inconsequential desktop-based telephony feature in the next version of OS X. The sum, equivalent to what Apple earned in four weeks last quarter, has been half disbursed. Another half remains in escrow until Dre meets his obligation for a 23 second appearance at an employee orientation event next week. Apple's CEO Tim Cook has assured everyone that he has "not forgotten about Dre...'s other money."

As part of the deal, Apple also received a broken music streaming service, a man with a thick rolodex, several large warehouses of overpriced headphones, a five-year advertising deal with Ellen Degeneres, and, inexplicably, Trent Reznor. According to experts familiar with depreciative assets, Apple plans on writing these off, which makes the effective price of the deal a much more palatable $2 billion.

While this marks the most expensive musical talent hired by a tech company for less than two minutes of actual work, it does conform to a Chronic trend in the tech industry. Previously, BlackBerry spent millions to hire Alicia Keyes for 45 seconds of smiling on stage. Intel granted Will.i.am hundreds of thousands of stock options to fist-bump a dozen chip designers for 33 seconds. And Snapchat hired Taylor Swift to spend 22 seconds with their unbearable CEO Evan Spiegel. 

Not to be Beaten by Dre, rumors are now swirling around Google potentially acquiring 17 seconds of Macklemore's time for "thrift-shop-level" prices.
