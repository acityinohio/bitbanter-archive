title: Twitch.tv Partners with Vladimir Putin for Controversial "Twitch Plays Ukraine"
---

*Bold followup to "Twitch Plays Pokemon" will plunge Eastern Europe into utter chaos*

Were you one of the millions enthralled by "Twitch Plays Pokemon?" Were you enthralled by watching thousands of players attempt to simultaneously control a single Pokemon Red protagonist? Were you glued to the never-ending, unpredictable drama; the endless shuffling between anarchy and democracy? Sad to see it go?

We here at Twitch.tv were. But the strong conclusion of Twitch Plays Pokemon has only set our sights higher. From now on, you may as well call us Emeril Lagasse, because we're about to kick it up a notch. In coordination with the Russian Federation, we are proud to announce our highly anticipated sequel, "Twitch Plays Ukraine." BAM!

Those aging GameBoy visuals? Gone. Replaced by constantly streaming, modified GoPros on top of real live MilitiaBoys, who may or may not be affiliated with the Russian Federation. Aging chiptuned sound effects? Where are we, the goddamned Tron arcade? Each underaged mercenary is equipped with enough mics to hear the gears of regime change in crystal-clear Dolby Digital 7.1.

...sorry, we didn't mean "gears of regime change." Putin says we have to say "self-determined liberation." Forget we said "regime change."

And that archaic chat-based control scheme? That would never work in a live-streamed warzone. Instead of a daunting list of confusing controls, online players will only collectively decide between two options for its squad of actual paramilitary killers (who are currently in a sovereign nation engaging in unquestionably illegal warfare). Twitch Plays Ukraine will offer two overarching voting mechanisms to reach consensus: "Kleptocracy" and "Oligarchy."

...again, we apologize, but Putin is now yelling at us over videoconference. Apparently we mistranslated the consensus mechanisms from the original Russian. "Kleptocracy" is actually "Communal Democracy" and "Oligarchy" is actually "Representative Democracy." He's making some pretty graphic threats so we're going to revert those ASAP. Apologies for the mixup; Russian is a tricky language.

Anyway, in "Communal Democracy" mode players must unanimously vote between two actions. If a unanimous vote cannot be reached within 15 seconds, the game's Supreme Commander (Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev) will arbitrarily decide. In "Representative Democracy" mode, the users vote on whether they want the Supreme Commander or the game's Tsar (Russian President Vladimir Putin) to decide on their behalf. In this mode, only a simple majority is required to elect a temporary representative! A game mode will select itself randomly, with the occasional veto by the Tsar at his sole discretion.

...okay so apparently that description was not Putin's cup of borscht, and he is now demanding that he retain ultimate control over the Twitch stream. We're going to make this concession, but only because he just sent photographic proof that he kidnapped our closest family members days ago. Oh god, Sarah, Jim, Molly, we love you, don't worry. We love you. Under labored breath, Putin just concluded the videoconference by muttering, "and pray I don't alter the deal any further."

So, um, yeah, Twitch Plays Ukraine is going to be an epic experiment guys. The real-world geopolitical consequences of your decisions will make Mass Effect's quaint choice-dependent storyline look like Pong, or something. Granted, you'll be completely constrained in your collective power, since you'll be presented false choices by an authoritarian regime as a lame attempt to hide its own unilateral actions. And you'll be censored every step of the way.

But look at it this way: you're still doing more than the UN! Game on, guys!
