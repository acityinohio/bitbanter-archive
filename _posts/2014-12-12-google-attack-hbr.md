One Friday afternoon in 2002---or was it Wednesday? Oh well, who cares, the story is apocryphal anyway---Larry Page walked into Google's office kitchen with a printout from Google's AdWords engine. With bold letters, he had written "THESE ADS ARE LITERALLY KILLING CHILDREN IN THE THIRD WORLD."

In most companies, this would have been considered cruel (and a rather outlandish, unfalsifiable claim to boot). But not at Google. Here, looking back with 12 years of rose-tinted glasses, former early employees can confidently say that this casual belittlement was fundamental to the narrative that led to them retiring on their own private islands. And some of those employees can ghost-weave that narrative into an entire book, perhaps as a PR prelude for an eventual run at some high-level US political office.

Unrelatedly, in their new book, *How Google Works*, Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg describe what happened next. The following Monday---or Tuesday? Who knows---a group of engineers had solved the problem, giving up witnessing one of their children's first steps, three school plays, and Bobby's clutch line drive during the playoff game. But they made Google a lot of money in the process, so that's pretty cool, and it's nice to have a private island even if Bobby refuses to speak to me. Sigh.

Anyway, this episode exemplifies how easy it is to fall into the trap of extrapolating anecdotes to establish qualitative axioms about something as nebulous as "culture"...or it will, after you read my bolded takeaways below!

**People want to get paid.** When it comes down to it, people respond to incentives. Employees are like rats, and companies are like Skinner boxes. By belittling his employees, but continuing to give them large stock grants, Page ensured that he could say whatever he wanted about people and they'd still do their damn jobs.

**Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.** Except with OpenSSL/Heartbleed. And all those crypto algos that the NSA helped develop. Actually, there are enough examples to basically call this trope an outright falsehood. But the point is, Google still works like a startup. Because of eyeballs and bugs. Not sure what I'm getting at here.

**People perform best at tasks for which they're hired.** Some CEOs would have told their marketing people to work on this engineering problem with AdWords. Or maybe their sales people, if they were feeling saucy. But not Page. He knew that engineers were the best folks to attack an engineering problem. It was a stroke of genius, worthy of Jack Welch's napkin collection.

**Great leaders get a lot of credit for being assholes.** When Page made everyone feel like shit, he was communicating something very important about Google's early culture. "I'm going to complain about a problem, and I expect it to be solved by posting my personal complaints in an unofficial, passive-aggressive capacity, and you better fix it." He had a passion for delegating tasks, and expecting it to get done, regardless of the manner in which the tasks were communicated. That kind of dick move is classic Silicon Valley, and thanks to Google's (and Jobs' Apple's) incredible success in the market, we can only assume it's a necessary part of any successful company. So next time you have an issue with your product or company, don't be direct or kind. Just put a passive-aggressive Post-It on the fridge and hope your employees still value your stock.
